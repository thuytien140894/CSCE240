 interfaces studies in visual culture editors mark j williams and adrian w b
 randolph dartmouth college this series sponsored by dartmouth college press
 develops and promotes the study of visual culture from a variety of critical
 and methodological perspectives its impetus derives from the increasing
 importance of visual signs in everyday life and from the rapid expansion of
 what are termed new media the broad cultural and social dynamics attendant to
 these developments present new challenges and opportunities across and within
 the disciplines these have resulted in a trans-disciplinary fascination with
 all things visual from high to low and from esoteric to popular this series
 brings together approaches to visual culture broadly conceived that assess
 these dynamics critically and that break new ground in understanding their
 effects and implications for a complete list of books that are available in

 many have encouraged and supported this project during its gestation and
 writing i thank the university of south carolina s college of arts and
 sciences for a semester s teaching leave which afforded me time to find the
 book s current shape and its provost s office for a humanities grant that
 funded development of augusta app the book s digital supplement the university
 would have found less to value in my work had i not been trained by some
 exceptional teachers principle among these is anne friedberg whose penchant
 for rigorous theorization and intricately nuanced prose challenge me to think
 and write more sharply even as she herself cannot i feel most fortunate to
 have studied with michael renov whose generosity and poise inspire me and
 whose gentle reminders regarding my first visible evidence keep me on track i
 thank john carlos rowe who early on encouraged me to try my hand at graduate
 school and i thank anne balsamo for cultivating my sense of the collaborative
 nature of interdisciplinary projects susan mary mellender wilke supported this
 work in its very earliest phases joining me at my first conferences as
 graduate student accompanying me on research trips and reviewing my prose kay
 potocki encouraged me to pursue my intellectual interests jon wilke helped me
 learn the language of biomechanics which became crucial to my investigations
 of design and expressivity and i thank curtis wilke whose recent illness has
 made me understand the importance of an autobiographical self i thank my
 colleagues susan courtney for so deftly mentoring me throughout the writing
 process laura kissel whose conversations asked me to think more precisely
 about the project and simon tarr who shared his incisive artistic talent i
 also thank greg wilsbacher who introduced me to the augustas gordon humphries
 who helped me prepare the photographic images that appear in the book and
 jeremy greenberger who spent hundreds of hours programming the book s digital
 supplement in its penultimate instantiation the book benefitted from two
 readers for the press i thank steve anderson and nanna verhoeff their generous
 insights have made this a better book duncan buell has made the book s digital
 supplement possible through him i have learned how to describe the
 computational mathematics that manage our mobile present our work together for
 the neh-funded humanities gaming institute 2010 and on desperate fishwives
 2011 12 and ghosts of the horseshoe 2012 present has inspired me to be a more
 agile interdisciplinary thinker if i am digital humanist i learned how to be
 one from him i look forward to our continued collaboration mark garrett cooper

 augusta
<< txt >>
<< page >>
 augusta is a proper noun it names a unique instance of a person place or some
 other entity capitalization indicates as much although failure to capitalize
 would not necessarily invalidate its status as a proper noun on occasion this
 proper noun assumes the plural form augustas in which case it refers to a
 group of entities deemed unique adjectival declensions exist as in augustan
 rome importantly any one proper noun might very well signify any number of
 possible referents 1 for the purposes of this preamble let s assume that
 augusta names a city in the state of georgia in the united states and let s
 take as a point of departure the independent insurance agent amateur filmmaker
 and augusta native scott nixon b 1901 d 1980 who from the 1930s through the
 1950s documented no fewer than thirty-six augustas these disparate augustas
 nixon compiled into a home movie of approximately sixteen minutes the
 resulting reel is called the augustas and it represents various augustas that
 nixon encountered as he traveled the united states during the course of the
 film we discover that augusta specifies a township a plantation a military
 academy a fort a street and a flower called the hardy phlox augusta
<< page >>
 the flower
 s name repays investigation the augusta is a member of the rubiaceae plant
 family four species comprise the genus in which a abbreviates augusta a
 longifolia native to brazil a rivalis native to central america a vitiensis
 native to the fiji islands and a austro-caladonica native to new caledonia
 this tidy classification scheme is a relatively recent achievement apparently
 the number and names of the species belonging to the genus had long been a
 matter in dispute in a 1997 article piero g delprete of the institute of
 systematic botany at the new york botanical garden explains that for over a
 century most herbarium specimens still bear annotation of a confused
 assortment of scientific names 2 after conducting extensive studies of about
 500 herbarium specimens delprete concludes augusta with the inclusion of
 lindenia is represented by four species of rheophytic shrubs 3 while there is
 high morphological variation among species of the augusta which probably
 accounts for the long-standing question regarding species typification
 delprete grounds his findings on molecular data that prove conclusive the
 complex history of the genus s nomenclature originates in an 1828/29
 publication by johann emanuel pohl titled plantarum brasiliae as delprete
 recounts the austrian botanist and mineralogist joined a group of scientists
 on expedition to brazil where he first described five species of the plant the
 trip was arranged as part of the nuptial celebrations honoring the marriage of
 archduchess leopoldina daughter of emperor franz i of austria also king of
 hungary and bohemia to dom pedro later pedro i of brazil at the time of the
 expedition caroline augusta formerly princess of bavaria was wife to emperor
 francis i pohl dedicated his then newly discovered plant to the empress of
 austria caroline augusta delprete quotes pohl s dedication this new name
 witness of reverence and gratitude is derived from that of her majesty
 caroline augusta empress of austria
<< page >>
 who most holy priestess of flora with her
 whole heart does everything to strew flowers in the path of her most august
 spouse the emperor 4 in this tribute to her majesty pohl links wife/empress
 and husband/emperor etymologically she caroline augusta who inspires reverence
 and gratitude and he who is most revered that is most august 5 it should not
 come as a surprise that augusta is a feminine form of the name of the roman
 emperor augustus wikipedia sharing roots with august from the classical latin
 augustus meaning consecrated venerable and by extension revered oxford english
 dictionary oed online the same latin root underpins august the eighth month of
 the julian and gregorian calendars which supplanted the sixth month of the
 ancient roman calendar in 8 bc sextilis or sixth month was renamed august in
 honor of caesar augustus the renaming served to commemorate the most
 significant achievements that secured the emperor s rise to power events that
 occurred in the month we call august even this very schematic etymological
 tour from town to amateur home movie to flower to the feminine declension of a
 masculine noun suffices to make a simple and foundational point in addition to
 naming its proper referent any specific augusta also points to rather too many
 histories altogether i am interested in the indeterminacy of reference opened
 by this constellation of augustas especially because such indeterminacy seems
 no rare phenomenon but rather a defining feature of daily life when nixon s
 home movie invites us to consider the perhaps haphazard but certainly curious
 string of associations leading from town to phlox it challenges us to continue
 the experiment that seems to find augusta everywhere one looks what would be
 involved in finding and keeping track of augustas of all varieties fortunately
 our digital present provides tools ready to hand

 finding augusta habits of mobility and governance in the digital era is
 interested in routine practices that define the mobile present when digital
 technologies set places persons things and information in constant motion
 habits of navigation assume decisive social and political importance while
 most discussions of mobile media treat them as tracking devices freedom
 machines or both i argue that we should attend to the everyday habits of
 finding places persons and information that mobile media encourage and
 discourage in this regard i make three claims first mobile media encourage
 population managers to think less in terms of surveillance and more in terms
 of tracking i suggest that this shift is less a revolutionary change brought
 about by new technologies than a change in emphasis whereby mobile handheld
 devices supplement long-standing even ancient techniques of governance second
 i argue that the handheld quality of mobile technologies requires a threefold
 understanding of human individuals as biological beings expressive e g
 cognitive subjects and members of populations third i propose that
 acknowledging how we inhabit bodies tracked through mobile networked visual
 media offers possibilities for intervening in the techniques of governance
 that define and manage persons within

 populations in this way i consider how
 biopolitical modes of governance work as well as how they might change

 once upon a traveling salesman
<< txt >>
 from the 1930s through the 1950s independent insurance agent and amateur
 filmmaker scott nixon documented the various augustas he encountered during
 his travels throughout the united states 1 he filmed towns streets and schools
 called augusta and subsequently edited the sequences together into a
 sixteen-and-a-half-minute compilation film 2 called the augustas the film can
 be understood as a record of his travels to various augustas but this is only
 one if perhaps the most common interpretation there are no fewer than
 thirty-six instances edited into a montage of disparate locations and scenes
 all identified as augusta or some variant thereof for example augustaville or
 the augusta the augustas are identified by signage intertitles labeled still
 images train schedules or maps in this way the film confronts its spectator
 with the question of how to interpret augusta for example the fifth augusta
 appears in black caps on a simple white rectangular board the name augusta is
 underscored by a solidly painted arrow pointing screen left indicating that
 augusta is located in that direction presumably one need only turn left and
 one will find augusta some distance offscreen even as one has encountered
 augusta framed within the shot if by habit we assume augusta to be a place so
 named the arrow and related strategies in the film also inspire speculation
 there may be other options once our attention shifts to the name itself
<< comp pls insert fig_00_04 about here >>
 while the inspiration behind this work may lie in the fact that nixon himself
 lived in augusta georgia the principle or key governing his cinematic tour is
 not known the assembled film follows neither chronology nor geography the lack
 of a readily
<< page >>
 decodable order prompts us to consider that augusta may be its
 own key that one point may be simply to celebrate augusta as a keyword label
 qua search term the signifier plays mobius-like across three registers of
 interpretation it may appear painted on a road sign it may be the indexical
 trace of a place once visited it may function symbolically as a word
 signifying a referent place or otherwise it matters whether one sees a filmed
 image of a road sign specifying augusta or sees the word in an intertitle one
 s interpretation depends on such differences for example the appearance of a
 road sign calls to mind the social habit of navigating to a place of
 destination while the intertitle bespeaks
<< page >>
 the filmmaker s guiding hand in
 structuring interpretation either image however can name a place we might be
 seeing in the surrounding or a subsequent mise-en-scene similarly the
 inclusion of any image whatsoever in this context suggests that we are looking
 at an augusta even if we cannot immediately determine which one by the reel s
 conclusion augusta is revealed to designate a county in virginia a high school
 and a military academy in ohio a fort in pennsylvania and streets in both
 georgia and south carolina the hardy phlox augusta concludes the show on one
 hand the indexical image of signage naming augusta as augusta produces a kind
 of certainty of reference there is an augusta being photographed or filmed in
 each instance of augusta on the other hand the very multiplication of augusta
 dismantles assumptions regarding the stability of any single augusta as
 referent we discover that finding augusta is a problem even as our desire for
 and expectation of doing so is facilitated by the film s strategy of
 organization moreover insofar as we learn that augusta may not be a place at
 all we must contend with the prospect that it might very well be a state of
 mind a way of seeing and ordering the world the word label augusta turns out
 to be powerful in its organizing capabilities and feeble in its designating
 abilities its slippery operations are made doubly slippery by the fact of
 being filmed and arranged in the film given the medium s indexical and iconic
 qualities in all of these various dimensions we might understand the augustas
 to demonstrate a concern for information retrieval and more specifically how
 the process of recording storing and arranging information relates to the
 project of finding information persons places and things in this regard
 despite the fact that it is a decidedly analog artifact the film alludes to
 computational processes that characterize our mobile present the puzzle that
 is nixon s the augustas has an unexpected
<< page >>
 counterpart in computational
 mathematics and computer science the traveling salesman problem or tsp 3 the
 tsp is a problem of determining optimal paths through a given number of
 specified points in its paradigmatic form the tsp asks what is the best route
 for traveling round-trip to some number of cities this is precisely the type
 of problem companies employing traveling salesmen or in more current
 vernacular sales representatives confront 4 the idiom time is money applies
 out of fiscal necessity one must minimize travel costs by spending less time
 on the road or in the air the most efficient itinerary is critical but how to
 identify such an itinerary turns out to be surprisingly difficult as computer
 scientist and mathematician william j cook explains the traveling salesman is
 foremost among the route planers sic 5 in support of this claim cook cites
 correspondence between a 1920s traveling salesman and the company for which he
 works 6 in a letter criticizing his employer s routing of his tour he
 announces that he has changed his itinerary for a more suitable one one that
 does not have him jumping all over the map 7 since presumably his employer
 also desires an efficient itinerary this is a contest not of aims but of
 expertise solutions to the tsp are optimal routes but finding these routes is
 a complex problem in fact the tsp still stands among the impossible problems
 in computational mathematics one among several problems no efficient algorithm
 is known to solve the tsp has many variations including such challenges as
 scheduling fedex delivery routes coordinating airline flight schedules and
 routing mobile phone calls 8 nonetheless computer scientists regard the tsp as
 impossible because one cannot determine efficiently a singular key that is a
 plan or search term for sorting various stops or nodes into a fail-safe route
 or tour 9 even if we specify a point of departure and return a variety of
 potential paths always exist any number of factors for example ice accident

<< page >>
 traffic and roadblock might potentially impede or alter any one designated
 route without a reliable principle of organization to govern the order of
 travel effectively sequencing a series of stops proves contingent on a wide
 array of variables moreover the number of possible routes i e tours increases
 exponentially with any increase in the number of stops 10 scott nixon traveled
 the united states during the same years that mathematicians in the united
 states began focusing more concertedly on the tsp this is a coincidence
 insofar as the person scott nixon his profession and his film had so far as i
 have been able to determine no direct involvement with formulating the tsp as
 an academic problem it is not at all a coincidence that both nixon and the
 mathematicians who defined the tsp inhabited a particular moment in the
 history of mobility and information a moment when profit travel navigation
 information retrieval and manipulation and pleasurable expertise were closely
 associated that moment gives birth to our mobile digital present despite
 obvious differences nixon s version of the tsp and the version officially
 named by the rand corporation in 1949 are equally relevant when it comes to
 figuring out what it means to manage persons vehicles goods currency ideas and
 information they teach comparable lessons in both cases a potential for
 failure shadows the project of mapping any single best or optimal itinerary i
 am referring to a failure not only to find the best route but also to discover
 the principle or logic by which any particular itinerary has been decided for
 planners and administrators this means that problems of routing and locating
 are never solved so much as managed for individuals this condition of
 uncertainty encourages patterns decided as much by habit as by careful
 preparation at the same time the ever-present possibility that habitual
 patterns will fail in a particular case opens onto new possibilities whether
 these be alternative routes tsp or
<< page >>
 alternative interpretations scott nixon and
 so similar fedex routes may or may not result in similar delivery schedules
 and we with mobile technologies in hand may or may not connect with a desired
 contact we submit ourselves daily to the volatility of the traveling salesman
 problem to the fact that small changes in the costs and connections that
 define a particular problem can result in large changes in the optimal
 solution we only notice this when habit or routine fails read in tandem the
 traveling salesman problem and nixon s the augustas invite us to consider both
 the pervasiveness and the inherent instability involved in the routine work of
 finding and tracking such consideration moreover casts new light on the
 administrative logic that requires these operations by approaching the topic
 of new media s role in relation to biopower through this old traveling
 salesman problem this book contributes to an understanding of the relationship
 between bodies and technologies of administration in the digital era mobility
 its organization and potentiality is the defining problem of this present

 both scott nixon independent insurance agent and the traveling salesman
 problem allow us to consider the increasing significance of mobility in the
 digital age as early as 2000 sociologist john urry argued that to study
 society one must address the problem of mobilities 11 here mobilities refers
 to various bodies in motion including not only people objects and images but
 also money information and waste indeed mobilities applies to the diversity of
 movements circulations fluctuations transactions and exchanges both natural
 and artificial
<< dcq >>
 that comprise what michel foucault in security territory population calls the
 milieu 12 like urry i am interested in how mobilities of all sorts
<< page >>
 shape
 habits of living in thinking about and engaging the world productive for such
 consideration is the increasing prominence of what mimi sheller terms the
 transdisciplinary scholarship of critical mobilities research also called
 mobility studies critical mobilities thinking and mobilities theory 13 such
 scholarship sheller suggests brings together insights from the social sciences
 cultural visual and media studies as well as geography in the process it
 generates new possibilities for thinking relations among bodies and
 technologies critical mobilities research encourages thinking that complicates
 conceptions of what mobility is and how it functions in the world it
 acknowledges that mobility operates across a number of domains and according
 to a horizontal dispersal in mobilities john urry identifies five
 interdependent mobilities that comprise sociality and management thereof
 corporeal travel for leisure work migration and escape physical movement of
 objects purchases exchanges and transfers imaginative travel e g visual and
 print media virtual travel e g electronic media and communicative travel e g
 person-to-person messages via telephone and text message etc these transpire
 as complex and ever-shifting circulations thus questions central to mobilities
 research emphasize interconnections among various mobilities and not movement
 in the abstract e g from point a to point b furthermore mobilities theorists
 recognize that mobility systems involve pauses lapses stasis interferences and
 turbulence that is various immobilities sheller characterizes immobilities
 citing urry stating that the conditions that produce multiple fixities and
 moorings often depend on a substantial physical scale 14 for example walls
 borders check-points and gated zones stabilize even if only temporarily flows
 of all sorts likewise immobile platforms and infrastructures including
 transmitters roads stations satellite dishes airports docks
<< page >>
 factories reshape
 the landscape in very concrete ways but ways that simultaneously facilitate
 continued circulations 15 this line of thinking emphasizes the tension between
 a spatialized ordering principle and a sense of fluidity and mobility the
 former seeks to fix or to place and thereby locate and render legible that
 which is mobile it is compelled to do so by the latter sense which entails
 both the personal possibility of movement and the anxiety of become unmoored
 lost 16 in its inquiry into the nature and function of textured rhythms
 constitutive of contemporary mobility systems critical mobilities research
 revises how we think about movement people and place 17 in the process it
 readily acknowledges the fact that technologies mobile devices included factor
 largely in facilitating mobilities of all sorts as tim cresswell points out
 the historical specificity of the technologies that produce mobilities
 necessarily inform understandings of oneself one s surroundings and one s
 movements 18 in the mobile present data trails map us in relation to physical
 locations location awareness proves increasingly essential to understanding
 subjectivity while place has always mattered eric gordon and adriana de souza
 e silva explain that our mobile technologies foster a particular concern for
 and attention to location they refer to this kind of awareness as networked
 locality which they attribute to the fact that virtually everything is located
 or locatable 19 as they indicate this condition of existence necessarily
 alters how institutions and communities function and interact here paul
 dourish and genevieve bell s discussion of mobility and technology proves
 useful approaching questions of mobility from the perspective of ubiquitous
 computing ubicomp they draw attention to the ways that technological
 infrastructures determine the organization and meaning of space when we begin
 to think the portability of practice as enabled or denied by the
<< page >>
 kind of
 connectivity we enjoy we necessarily understand our relation to our
 surroundings differently 20 for example thinking in terms of cellular network
 access wi-fi service provider range of signal and proximity to power outlets
 informs our conceptions and interpretations of and movements through our
 surroundings but also such thinking is suggestive of how mobilities of various
 sorts are facilitated hindered and re directed as dourish and bell indicate
 the massive technological infrastructure enabling these new forms of concern
 with location imply power geometries that define patterns of access and shape
 how when and where people things information and so forth move if one has cell
 phone coverage here but not there it is likely due to some combination of
 corporate profit calculation and local regulation not surprisingly scholars
 interested in mobilities have increasingly turned their attention to portable
 not simply transportable 21 networked devices notably gerard goggin and ilpo
 koskinen offer compelling cultural interpretations of mobile technologies 22
 mizuko ito daisuke okabe and misa matsuda provide a pioneering account of
 mobile phones in japanese youth culture 23 and we are beginning to see a
 number of edited collections addressing cultural effects of mobile
 technologies 24 in a more theoretical vein jason farman has posited the
<< soq >>
 sensory-inscribed body in order to account for how we engage mobile interfaces
 and how we inhabit space while on the move 25 drawing on phenomenology he
 makes a case for understanding embodied experience as a being-in-the-world
 that is perceptually grounded intersubjectively informed and culturally
 specific even as it is simultaneously dispersed across digital networks
 complementarily nanna verhoeff has coined the term performative cartography as
 a means of conceptualizing how the mobile microscreen functions as a
 foucauldian dispositif 26 facilitating a procedural experience particular to
 what she terms
<< page >>
 the visual regime of navigation 27 navigation here refers to an
 active and creative process a making-in-motion that is not a result of
 cartography per se but a practice or action of moving toward a destination in
 the context of mobile devices navigating to a there frequently involves touch
 e g index finger upon or across a touch screen 28 read alongside critical
 mobilities and related research work in media studies and theory helps us to
 develop an account of how and to what end mobilities are regulated in taking a
 foucauldian approach i aim to extend lines of inquiry developed by wendy chun
 alex galloway richard grusin lisa parks and eugene thacker 29 both chun and
 galloway with thacker approach the question of governance from the perspective
 of computer technologies chun theorizes the fiber optics of internet
 technology in terms of a mutually informing relation between control and
 freedom she questions the distinction between hardware and software in order
 to focus our attention on the problem of sociocultural programmability
 galloway takes up programming protocols and gaming algorithms in order to
 consider how code conditions possibilities for behavior and lisa parks
 examines the ways in which satellite footprints map populations according to
 signal reach and coverage as well as how aerial imagery as produced by u s
 satellite reconnaissance systems and global media platforms e g google earth
 articulate visual military and corporate economies of power in order to manage
 flows of information its representation and its interpretation while parks
 chun and galloway focus on media technologies and infrastructure richard
 grusin discusses how post-9/11 media practices along with governmental
 techniques have served to premediate that is manage in anticipatory fashion
 the public s collective moods and perceptions in particular he considers how
 premediation operates at the level of affectivity wherein
<< page >>
 the body responds to
 events prior to any conscious recognition or interpretation of them eugene
 thacker too understands populations as biological entities in addition to
 coauthoring with galloway on the protocological control of networks he
 demonstrates how biological networks are implicated in managing populations
 referring to the twin threats of bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases
 such as swine and avian flues and sars he observes that the transmission of
 biological contaminants is both facilitated and secured by means of managing
 transportation e g air travel and communications e g postal service networks
 for him the turn to biodefense as a tactical response to such risks links
 information networks and epidemic networks in a way that epitomizes
 biopolitics in the twenty-first century 30 in pursuing an argument about how
 governance works on populations finding augusta develops these precedents in
 understanding individuals as members of populations whereby they are socially
 networked studied tracked and defined by and through the pervasive programs of
 productive regulation that have been theorized by michel foucault as
 governmentality moving beyond cultural studies interpretations of devices of
 mobility such as the sony walkman this book also intervenes in more recent
 discussions of visual and media studies that tend to position mobile devices
 of connectivity in terms of prosthetic extensions or cyborgian incorporations
 informed by research in mobilities the book addresses the proliferation and
 sprawl of the sundry dispersals disseminations distributions and so forth that
 exemplify our digital present in the following chapters i focus on questions
 about the changing meanings of location and locatability about investments in
 where-ness and about legibility as opposed to visibility i likewise consider
 how notions of findability inform biopolitical techniques of population
 management or governance 31 finally i engage the question of

 creatures of habit
<< txt >>
 we are creatures of habit frequently progressing through our days on autopilot
 we can accomplish familiar tasks without any explicit thought whatsoever we
 often overlook the routines of everyday life and take their completion for
 granted for example we might travel a familiar route and arrive at our
 destination unable to recall much of anything about the particular journey we
 might pause to notice the hazardous peculiarity of speeding down the highway
 while preoccupied with some vexation or impending deadline but miraculously we
 more frequently arrive alive and distracted this normalcy born of repetition
 and familiarity has been explained in different ways for the purposes of my
 argument bio philosophy semiotics and neurophysiology may usefully be read
 together to provide an account of habit as an interrelated and ongoing process
 in this process habit is always habit-in-formation and habit-as-change such an
 approach allows us to think of populations in terms that recognize that
 individual persons are simultaneously vital that is nonconscious
 meaning-making and social entities beginning in chapter 2 i turn to henri
 bergson who offered an early philosophical account of how habit and habit
 change might transpire and to pragmatist charles sanders peirce who posited a
 semiotic account of habit and habit change my understanding of these early
 twentieth-century humanists has been informed by more recent work in
 neurophysiology particularly that of antonio damasio damasio explains on many
 occasions the
<< page >>
 execution of our actions is controlled by nonconscious processes
 32 such processes are trained by the conscious intention of repeated practice
 and in the normal-functioning brain this means that they serve to amplify the
 reach of consciousness 33 outsourcing expertise to the nonconscious space is
 what we do when we hone a skill so finely that we are no longer aware of the
 technical steps needed to be skillful 34 and so we arrive home from work each
 day without ever really thinking about it we negotiate familiar surroundings
 on foot while texting friends or posting mobile updates and we aim frame and
 snap images on the fly in short we tend toward absentmindedness and it s a
 good thing too without the capacity for absentmindedness which damasio refers
 to as the cognitive unconscious 35 our conscious processes would not be free
 for creative use 36 for analysis problem solving and planning the submerged
 operations of general knowledge and reasoning make possible the completion of
 simple tasks without concentrated deliberation or planning in fact studies
 have shown that nonconscious processes are actually capable of beneficial
 spur-of-the-moment decision making this is because nonconscious space is wide
 open and can hold and manipulate many variables 37 as such it has the
 potential to produce the best choice in a small window of time 38 and this is
 because it has learned from various instances of prior conscious deliberation
 and therefore operates according to conscious intentions and goals 39 that is
 cognitive unconscious processes do not exist of their own accord without
 external influences they are informed by biases connected to previously

 influenced or even accomplished

 by nonconscious processes raises questions
 about individual agency and more to the point responsibility but such concern
 mistakes the relationship between consciousness and the nonconscious processes
 that support conscious deliberative action ultimately the cooperative
 interplay between conscious and nonconscious processes develops over time as
 habit with repetition and practice moreover the conventions and rules by which
 we may initially acquire particular cognitive unconscious tendencies do not
 necessarily result in permanent patterns of influence we can modify
 nonconscious procedures and action in ways that alter how we perform the
 rituals and routines of everyday life in fact health and social behavior can
 be revised with intense conscious rehearsal of procedures and actions we wish
 to see nonconsciously realized 41 simply put habitual actions and
 understandings can and do change this is so in part because conscious
 alternations of the cognitive unconscious are possible

 explains the various tsp-informed processes that ensure findability broadly
 speaking and demonstrates how reader participants might begin to explore how
 they themselves are tracked in this way the chapter draws attention to the
 intensity of tracking built into our mobile devices and our habits of using
 them chapter 2 in hand and on the go design neuroscience and habits of

 study for thinking about the particularities of contemporary practices i argue
 that because mobile devices are almost always in hand they encourage
 spontaneous and pervasive recording of routine transactions texts mobile-image

 continuous account of where a person is and what the person is doing rhythm
 and pacing of abbreviations acronyms keyword tags and canted and blurred
 images that punctuate our routines provide evidence of a different kind of
 expressivity no longer the province of self-aware intentionality the artifacts
 generated by mobile devices being in hand and on are indexes of an impulse to
 document i contend that such practice occurs at the level of the organism and
 therefore at the level of habit and habit formation but also we must consider
 the mediation of such self-record by algorithms designed to parse data for
 similarity regularity and popularity as well as to assign gps coordinates and
 time stamps to strings of digital artifacts together our habit of announcing
 where-ness and our devices capacities for locating us in real time allow us to
 consider how self-expression interacts with calculability and findability to
 facilitate contemporary governance

 chapter 4 secured mobilities how to think
 about populations demonstrates that we should think of governance in terms of
 tracking rather than surveillance following michel foucault s lead i trace
 contemporary biopolitics back to augustan rome this longer view encourages me
 to recontextualize the revolutionary potential howard rheingold attributed to
 smart mobs in his influential 2002 book of that title i cite a number of
 recent global events including the 2011 arab spring and popular happenings
 such as flash mob performances to show that the range of sociocultural
 practices enabled by mobile networked devices continue the genealogy of
 biopolitical governance limned by foucault the very infrastructures that power
 our mobile devices so that we can be newly connected also ensure our
 locatability we rarely think about this and are surprised when confronted with
 for example dropped calls or inadequate cellular service the example of
 augustan rome underscores that fact that securing mobilities of all sorts by
 making their locations predictable has been an objective of governance for
 millennia i emphasize that in the twenty-first century location preempts
 privacy mobility trumps democracy and being connected matters more than being
 smart that we are in the habit of overlooking these defining characteristics
 of our mobile present demonstrates a complicity with forms of governance we
 might better understand as a response this chapter works to bring the previous
 three chapters into relief in order to make explicit how real-time tracking
 might also afford possibilities for real-time intervention in the conclusion i
 posit habit change as a mode of intervention in biopolitical governance i cite
 augusta app as an experiment in developing the means of such intervention this
 app aspires to make apparent the processes of tracking that typify
 contemporary governance by enlisting a select but potentially limitless
 community of participants in the process it seeks to concretize a

 pervasive
 sociocultural blindness we are encouraged to overlook the myriad ways movement
 and connection entail being on grid and therefore trackable the digital
 present inherits this condition of existence in part from earlier photographic
 practices including those apparent in scott nixon s the augustas in addition
 to numerous places persons and things augusta also names an experimental space
 designed to investigate the conditions of possibility for any habit change
 whatsoever this makes augusta app unlike other mobile locative artworks such
 as rafael lozano-hemmer s amodal suspension 2003 and john craig freeman and
 mark skwarek s more recent border memorial frontera de los muertos 2012 that
 pursue explicitly political engagements rather augusta app seeks to encourage
 attentiveness to the various ways our technologies map us and our activities
 while other theorists have proposed for example an affirmative biopolitics
 roberto esposito or take up foucault s later interest in ethics john protevi
 jeffrey t nealon i prefer charles sanders peirce s conception of habit change
 for its more concrete engagement with daily semiotic activity in doing so i
 endeavor to limn a politics that might be more pervasive if less
 conventionally oppositional in order to intimate how such mundane intervention
 might take place

 quick response qr codes like the one here address a need for increased data
 storage and take advantage of the fact that many of us have mobile networked
 devices ready at hand invented in japan in 1994 for the purposes of tracking
 vehicles during automobile manufacturing the qr code may carry numeric
 alphanumeric and binary information and accommodates special characters such
 as japanese kanji 1 this technology dramatically extends the
 information-carrying capacity of conventional barcodes which are limited to
 twenty digits qr codes have a data capacity hundreds of times greater because
 they store information in both vertical and horizontal directions moreover the
 position detection patterns defining three of the four corners of the symbol
 allow them to be read in any orientation in addition to displaying information
 qr codes can be configured to connect to wireless networks and to open web

 lack the storage capacity to facilitate website access qr codes belong to a

 screen which allows them to access data regarding others and their engagements
 with the book via qr codes in the text and the app in combination these
 dimensions provide users with an experience that proposes to illuminate the
 book s central claim because handheld networked technologies create habits
 that regulate populations those habits may be revised by communities of
 participants who are themselves counted as members of a population 6 a
 magnifying loupe organizes the augusta app interface allowing a participant to
 navigate fields of interaction and review 7 the lens of the loupe offers two
 kinds of interaction depending on whether it is transparent or opaque in
 transparent mode the loupe opens onto the device s camera view in this mode
 one can scan qr codes dispersed throughout the book as well as take images for
 posting to augusta feed which is the app s most interactive feature 8 the
 opaque mode allows one to explore augusta app related content by rotating the
 loupe one cycles through the four channels that define varying degrees of
 interactivity augusta map makes tracking obvious by visualizing the heuristic
 of the traveling salesman problem requiring no active input from the
 participant it simply harvests participants location coordinates if they allow
 their gps-enabled device to transmit them traces of their movements then
 display against thirty distinct readily identifiable and still locatable
 augustas that nixon documented across twenty-three states the application maps
 participants not only against an established itinerary of nixon s augustas but
 also against additional augustas registered over time by the broader augusta
 app community participants can be monitored by the application in real time in
 addition to location coordinates participants scans of qr codes are recorded
 and their various contributions to augusta feed are archived when a user of
 the application physically passes through one of nixon s augustas or levels up
 the app pushes to the augusta photobox a related image of a single frame of
 the preserved film or another relevant i e to nixon

 of the book in the meantime augusta ledger maintains statistics regarding
 individual participants progress as they traverse the book scan qr codes
 contribute to the augusta feed and encounter physical locations called augusta
 it offers information of comparison and contrast across the augusta app
 community based on participants habits of interaction contribution and
 mobility moreover it parses these transactions merges resulting data with the

 ever-shifting semantic visualization that serves to map what augusta is or
 signifies at any given moment 10 participants can check their progress and
 statistics regarding the rate and degree of their participation as these
 compare with other reader participants augusta ledger calculates and provides
 measures of these various transactions

 me by persons who might readily assume augusta to be a place or by those who

 develop around this book s concerns regarding tracking findability and the
 management of populations my hope is that augusta app will evoke critical
 awareness about and engagement with the infrastructures and technologies that
 make governance possible in the twenty-first century as opposed to motivating

 augusta ledger
<< txt >>
 the augusta ledger employs semantic visualization that is a network
 representation of patterns and relations among keywords its initial interface
 presents a participant with a visual rendering of the original or root data
 set strictly based on the book s contents following the conventions of network
 visualization as described by manuel lima in visual complexity mapping
 patterns of information words function as vertices while lines indicate
 interconnections 14 sparsely used terms and terms of negligible significance e
 g prepositions articles pronouns and similar stop words do not appear in the
 application s depiction of the book s network of keywords as might be expected
 terms calculated to have high degrees of relevance initially appear more
 boldly and in the foreground of the screen varying thickness and length of
 lines defines strength of relatedness between terms but because the
 application is explicitly interested in each participant s interactions
<< page >>
 the
 visualization is potentially ever shifting as participants interact with and
 contribute to the application s content data the svd algorithm is used to
 recompute the relations among keywords and valences of particular terms this
 iterative procedure registers shifts in semantic variations and clusters in
 real time this results in the redistribution of keywords and their degrees of
 relation in this way individual reader participants have the capability to
 alter the image of what the book is about insofar as the application s
 software interprets participation it reveals those aspects of the book the
 community of participants finds most compelling how individual participants
 engage affects what the book means and how it has meaning that the program as
 authored by computer scientists tracks multiple participants means that
 collective acts might very well relegate to the background aspects of the
 argument i the author consider central in this sense the book-app system
 aspires to enact an ongoing procedural rhetoric that is a participation in and
 performance of a system of rules governing particular conditions of being and
 relation more than execute a singular persuasive act 15 certainly one could
 argue that the application recognizes participants as individuals of agency or
 that it democratizes the book but the fact that augusta ledger along with
 augusta app s other features responds to participant inputs also registers the
 fact of surveillance or more aptly tracking the original lsi-based rendering
 of the book only exists at the launch of the 2 0 version of the application
 after the launch and as would-be participants interact the visualization
 metamorphoses over time and in relation to the book s readership and their
 experimentation with it participants interactions with the book are captured
 registered processed and displayed in this context personal choice to
 experiment with the app that is should a reader opt to do so provides the
 grounds for thinking about a mutually constitutive relation between choice
<< page >>
 and
 governance which according to michel foucault are indexes of a well-managed
 milieu governance involves both willingness to engage in the experiment
 encouraged by the book and app and willingness to have one s motions and
 reading habits tracked to enable that experimentation again willingness to
 participate is key and not at all guaranteed through their engagement
 participants might very well refine the texture of the book s argument they
 will likely also test it but they do so by means of the very biopolitical
 techniques that function to manage the various flows and mobilities that
 typify contemporary life internet and database search tools offer an expedient
 example google search sets the paradigm through what astrid mager calls its
<< soq >>
 service-for-profile model 16 as google users well know google keeps track of
 their query histories and link selections in exchange for free use of its
 service this is in part how google s search engine streamlines online
 searching and swiftly provides access to information that aptly reflects users
 interests locations and desires 17 its efficient return of statistically
 relevant links to an inordinate number of possible queries makes it appealing
 and useful and while it is possible to disable certain features e g cookies
 and clear browser cache and search history many google users opt out and
 others never think to do so even if one practices these kinds of
 self-protective or privacy measures google cashes in on each user s search
 habits precisely because it can constitute that very refusal as a valuable
 data point as christian fuchs notes citing nicholas carr google tracks people
 s everyday behavior online it sources valuable intelligence from the patterns
 the behavior reveals 18 as a consequence the structure of google s index
 shifts our clicks manifest in some small degree and at some point in time
 iteratively a reconfiguration of the google index which facilitates improved
 future searches for ourselves and others but because the processes that
 reconfigure google s returns routinely
<< page >>
 go unquestioned they facilitate
 techniques of governance that we experience every day google s continuous
 surveilling of its users generates profit for the conglomerate it also serves
 to ensure the visibility
<< dcq >>
 and by extension manageability of those who take advantage even rely on its
 services google is able to track user interests e g queries and preferences e
 g link selections this allows the company to develop profiles that place users
 in part by ip address this is crucial for the targeted advertisements that
 appear at the margins of one s search windows 19 when such tracking of user
 data becomes mundane it can likewise seem benign insofar as google is a
 disciplinary technology it helps make routine or habitual the biopolitical
 enterprise of managing populations such management aims to ensure health
 safety and productivity we need not mistrust these aims however we might very
 well question our lack of participation in making them concrete searching the
 web or surfing the net suggestive of a mobility connotative of liberty
 provides google with the means to enable an accounting of such mobility by
 registering each user s engagement with its service every search query and
 link selection which are moves within and across a network of information e g
 web pages documents files etc is registered each user gets mapped google s
 foray into smartphones by means of its investment in the android operating
 system makes this even more literally the case google can track data in time
 to a user s movements in space 20 that we rarely question or even notice this
 state of affairs speaks to its efficacy as a means of regulating conduct even
 as we may fear identity theft we do not cease our credit card purchases let
 alone our google searches which often find us at sites that culminate in our
 inputting billing information our participation in processes of tracking is
 precisely what good management is about in the biopolitical sense we are
 governed best when
<< page >>
 practices like googling stabilize into routine when we
 ourselves habitually participate in the techniques that make it possible to
 predict and therefore anticipate and manage our conduct most frequently by
 offering us results products services and destinations that seem to be what we
 wanted all along augusta app attempts to intervene mathematically speaking the
 transformations that the application visualizes on mobile microscreen indicate
 something fundamental about the content of finding augusta not only does its
 meaning change over time but also nonhuman actors play a role in changing it
 augusta app and in particular the augusta ledger functionality illustrates the
 vitality of information and the malleability of its representation it
 underscores that information can acquire differently weighted significance
 according to quantity and distribution as determined by an algorithm s
 interpretation of a community of participants whose individual inputs soon
 become integral to defining the aggregate in tracking participant interactions
 and representing them augusta app makes the logic of biopolitics visible it
 encourages awareness of the kinds of processes that structure and secure our
 present it does so by inviting participants experimentally to engage the sorts
 of processes that google search for example seeks to make transparent

 computationally augusta app takes advantage of the heuristic of the traveling
 salesman problem tsp a mathematical optimization problem of calculating the
 shortest trip through a specified set of cities to provide the necessary
 ground against which a participant s progress might be charted the application
 identifies all the possible itineraries nixon might have taken in this
 framework nixon s editing of discrete film elements provides only one the

<< page >>
 first tour instance starting with augusta georgia home of the nixon family
 this component of the application deploys a tsp-informed algorithm to map
 nixon s original itinerary as indicated by the film s sequence of augustas
 georgia point of origin kansas new jersey indiana missouri maryland arkansas
 maine kentucky michigan illinois virginia ohio west virginia minnesota
 pennsylvania iowa oklahoma texas south carolina mississippi louisiana montana
 and back to the tour s originating augusta in georgia actually nixon s film
 offers thirty-six instances of augusta including a military academy and a
 number of streets in multiple states not to mention the hardy phlox flower 21
 while the application s instance of a tsp that maps nixon s travels ignores
 these noncity instances of augusta it will acknowledge these and similarly
 designated augustas as pertinent to tsp-related computational techniques in
 the ever-evolving semantic visualization located in the augusta ledger facet
 of augusta app while augusta app uses one of the basic formulae of the tsp to
 map nixon s possible tours the ultimate goal of tsp solutions is to find the
 optimal route through a given set of cities or nodes typically optimal means
 shortest less travel time and less expense equal a more direct accumulation of
 profit as a problem though the tsp can be used to reframe other problems a
 variety of tasks we take for granted every day can be converted into a tsp for
 which an efficient heuristically appropriate solution can be calculated
 usually a successfully efficient solution obscures the underpinning tsp
 framework as william j cook notes in his in pursuit of the traveling salesman
 mathematics at the limits of computation we are more likely to notice this
 type of problem solving in inadequacies or outright failure of its application
 22 for example we may be inconvenienced when a particular amazon delivery
 fails to arrive as specified or we might become frustrated when a delay causes
 us to miss a connecting flight

 the tsp heuristic has many applications in addition to delivery schedules and
 transit routes it has been used to map genomes to determine the most efficient
 way to drill and solder circuit boards and to design computer chips the
 approach has been essential to developing the algorithms that support basic
 mobile phone functionality the tsp underpins approaches to ensuring the
 continuity of mobile phone connectivity when a call needs to cross from one
 cellular tower to another it helps to optimize e-mail transmission as well as
 text- and picture-message delivery and it informs approaches to maintaining
 the accuracy and reliability of gps-based mobile navigational applications and
 related vehicular systems considered with the tsp in mind it becomes clear
 that the central concern of mobile networked communications is the routing of
 audio textual and video data routing is similar to arranging and tsp solutions
 have proved instrumental in designing methods for organizing vast quantities
 of data as well 23 in an earlier information age retrieval systems could
 overlook the problem posed by multiple versions of the same data set this is
 no longer the case when it is important to keep track of rapidly accumulating
 software variants wiki updates file modifications photo uploads and so on 24
 tsp-informed methods allow for constant updating to track the accumulation of
 variants whereas previous information-retrieval protocols proceeded according
 to hierarchical specification current practices work according to
 computational approximation for example library of congress lc subject
 headings develop granularity through the addition of modifiers as in augusta
 ga description and travel and relational databases typically define a
 parent-child structure to organize records in contrast methods that treat
 organization as a tsp seek efficient ways to associate individual objects
 globally within relatively unstructured and evolving sets of data where object
 might designate individual terms or entire documents
<< page >>
 25 the tsp is a useful
 means for identifying groups of data elements bearing similarity values that
 is likenesses among data elements similarity in the language of the tsp
 measures travel cost representationally similarity appears as a line an edge
 or arc and the terms whose similarities are being evaluated appear as points
 called nodes or vertices a node marks the terminus of an edge designating
 similarity the closer the nodes the more similar they are and the less costly
 it is to travel from one to the other this closeness can be represented as
 closeness by relative size by difference of color or in any other way one
 might devise behind the scenes tsp-oriented math can employ a vector-space
 model representational systems such as perspective map three-dimensional space
 onto a flat surface according to a relation among a vanishing point and x y
 axes in contrast a vector-space model represents patterns and densities of
 relation occurring in multidimensional space or k dimensions here the number
 of properties under consideration comprise the number of dimensions defining a
 field properties in this context might be unique keyword terms or categories
 relevant to a text or other object or a series of discrete texts or files
 moreover the number of dimensions fluctuates with the addition or deletion of
 properties since the complexity of an algorithm or computation often depends
 on the number of dimensions it is common to find that an algorithm begins by
 attempting to reduce the number of dimensions by determining the least useful
 or more negligible data points keywords or terms comprising a book s index are
 what s left after the negligible data is removed to identify the properties
 that relate to its objects augusta app employs singular value decomposition
 svd svd spatializes data 26 it transforms into numbers words documents or
 other material that can be treated as if they were words or documents these
 numbers designate points nodes or vertices within a multidimensional
<< page >>
 space
 where lines edges or arcs link nodes deemed similar as opposed to those
 considered spatially close the goal is to identify both points of greatest
 variation and clusters of strongly related points in order to arrive at a best
 approximation of the original configuration and then iterative configurations
 thereafter best approximation here refers to a representation of the original
 data using fewer points in this way svd reduces the dimensionality from k to k
 p where p can be thought of as the number of keyword terms that mathematically
 have little value in discriminating among documents or parts of documents of a
 text in order to bring strong relationships to the foreground as well as
 expose otherwise not readily discernible substructures that make a particular
 document unique reduction eliminates noise by eliminating statistical outliers
 the key feature of svd is that it extracts algorithmically identified
 significant terms and their relationships based on the computational
 processing of the data itself not on a library of congress like imposition
 from the top rather than have a preconfigured or predetermined expert template
 match a document to a predefined template as is the case with google s content
 score as described above which would be overly costly svd and latent semantic
 indexing lsi more broadly allow the description of any document to be defined
 in a mathematically sound way based on the data of the document itself in the
 process it distills a text to its component keyword terms as such svd
 establishes a root dictionary according to which similarities not physical
 proximities among various accruing documents might be identified ordered and
 visualized 27 in augusta app my colleagues in computer science have used a
 standard method for reducing dimensionality by trimming away those properties
 and dimensions that contribute little to semantic content and computational
 efficiency the number indicating dimensionality is represented by the variable
 k what appears
<< page >>
 on-screen then is not a static planar i e photographic view
 through a window as we might see in perspectival representation rather
 vertices designating properties populate a field according to degrees of
 proximity i e similarity properties mapped by augusta app include the book s
 initial list of index terms keywords derived from participant-contributed
 content as well as participant interaction with the semantic visualization e g
 touching a keyword node similarities travel time between terms and objects
 containing terms such as augusta and hardy phlox are interpreted as angular as
 opposed to linear distances between two points 28 each point exists along an
 axis in some multidimensional space in more familiar two-dimensional plots the
 proximity of one point to another is calculated according to the logic of as
 the crow flies in vector-space models however the proximity of any number of
 points is measured by degrees of separation instead of being interested in the
 spatial distance between a and b the vector-space model considers the
 potentially various relations among a b c z as these might be determined by a
 number of occurrences in the case of augusta app objects that share more of
 the same keyword occurrences cluster more closely together
<< comp pls insert qr01_04 about here >>
 conceptually this is how internet search engines such as google return results
 in response to queries composed of keyword strings 29 google does not use svd
 but rather a ranking system that uses complex link-structure algorithms any
 google search return involves adding together a content score and a pagerank
 popularity or importance score 30 the content score incorporates data
 regarding previous user hyperlinking in relation to a priori keywords while
 the importance score is based on the web s hyperlink structure suppose a
 google user submits the string augusta flower in processing the request the
 query module of the search engine automatically assumes the existence of the
 boolean and augusta and flower it accesses precomputed
<< page >>
 indexes such as the
 content index 31 web pages that contain both query terms are identified as
 relevant pages this list however likely boasts a vast number of pages many of
 which might very well specify florists in augusta georgia because of the
 number of possible returns the list of relevant pages is passed on to the
 ranking module where popularity rankings are imposed on the pages comprising
 the relevant set and thereby make the list of retrieved pages more manageable
 32 what appears on-screen in response to this type of query might strike one
 as completely off the mark for example a hardy phlox seeker might well be
 disappointed by the above search this is a consequence of the mathematics
 responsible for content and popularity scores nevertheless most of us find the
 odd return only a minor inconvenience and perhaps even a delightfully quirky
 surprise typically though google returns at least one good link and users tend
 to be quite facile at filtering out less useful ones users have also been
 shown to be comfortable with and rely heavily on relevance feedback having
 found one good response to a query a common and comfortable user action is to
 ask for more stuff like this the problem with this search logic is that
 popularity equates to reliability thus alternatives that might be better are
 not recognized as such because of how principles of likeness and reliability
 are defined within the preexisting abstraction of computational mathematics on
 a significantly less rigorous and less expansive scale than google s web page
 ranking model augusta app employs a simple vector-space information-retrieval
 ir model to parse the book s prose and to return a graphical representation of
 its keywords to the augusta ledger facet 33 semantic visualization is
 configured not alphabetically as one would find at the end of a book where in
 the case of finding augusta a traditional index may indeed be found but
 visually according to representational signifiers font
<< page >>
 size for frequency
 color for importance and word placement for degree of similarity and so forth
 moreover unlike a conventional book index which is static and fixed augusta
 app s keyword visualization is dynamic and multidimensional it responds to
 reader-participant inputs lsi reassesses keyword significance based on
 participant interaction as participants select words by touching them with
 their fingers it expands assuming a more pronounced orientation on-screen as
 it expands the node opens onto data about the term for example number of hits
 the term has accrued over time and across the community of participants as
 well as related content uploaded to the application s database by participants
 simultaneously lines of connection acquire greater or lesser density establish
 new points of relation and fall away from no-longer-viable affiliations
 insofar as the constellation of nodes and edges is graphed along n axes words
 are afforded a virtual mobility they shift horizontally and vertically across
 the screen s surface they dilate or contract according to their position along
 the lines of depth and degree of proximity as defined by any of the other axes
 e g frequency of appearance relations to other keywords etc lines reposition

 habit and augusta app
<< txt >>
 augusta app is an experiment in thinking individuals and populations together
 it offers participants new ways to reflect on
<< page >>
 and see more fully what is
 entailed in their routine uses of mobile devices and the populations they
 connect the application draws attention to the ways in which even the most
 minimally expressive but routine acts and gestures simultaneously proliferate
 streams of data carrying a mobile networked phone in the on position and
 pinching or swiping a screen are for many quotidian practices they register
 details about one s whereabouts and habits of usage not to mention recording
 data about the device itself this proliferation of information ensures one s
 findability augusta app uses scott nixon s compilation film the augustas and
 the traveling salesman problem tsp complementarily to highlight the relation
 between individual engagements with technology be it documenting on film
 various augustas or posting mobile announcements about location and more
 expansive efforts to keep track of movements including flows of data of
 populations with its intention to incite participants to consider habit
 formation and to constitute themselves as a community by means of that
 consideration the application endeavors to emphasize both that shared habits
 enable governance which turn people into a measurable population and that such
 habits may change it is worth returning yet again to the example of google
 which has succeeded in demonstrating how this kind of logic works a google
 search delivers relevant returns only if a large enough population of users
 chooses links that improve the query results returned by google s computation
 of relevance the fact that we readily input keyword terms and click search is
 indicative of our having become habituated to the google way of thinking each
 time we search to find what i want we are reinforcing behaviors already
 indicative of a population management problem search engines such as google
 assume that patterns of interest desire need and so on exist across a
 population moreover they cultivate these habits returning sufficiently
 reasonable returns to
<< page >>
 search queries they guarantee their own capacity for
 continued service like google search augusta app seeks to improve itself by
 engaging a population unlike google search it also aims to invite experimental
 consideration and discussion of how such a population might become a community
 that can participate meaningfully in revising how they as a population are so
 managed without determining in advance what such participation will entail or
 produce augusta app is built on the insight that it will involve habit change
 of course this change will only occur within the parameters provided by the
 application that said precisely because our technologies manage us through
 habit we would not intervene in them decisively through argument or
 counterregulation alone potential intervention will require the cultivation of
 new habits in the case of augusta app this may simply mean that participants
 nod in recognition when the app pings them or it may mean that they game the
 system
<< dcq >>
 for example by noising up or radicalizing augusta or augusta app either way
 something will have shifted in the way participants think about augusta
 charles sanders peirce provides a way to theorize such shifts in thinking and
 doing and vice versa according to peirce habit is the commonsensical character
 of human behavior although it often connotes passivity peirce sees habit as
 neither fault nor weakness rather habit materializes as a readiness to act
 such readiness is socially oriented and therefore abides a community of
 interpreters shared normative principles which at a very fundamental level
 regulate reason and belief and therefore action as karl-otto apel explains
 with respect to peirce the normative principles that shape habit are not
 simply technical instructions rather they establish the conditions whereby
 action is realized as a social style of life 34 under certain conditions or
 circumstances a person would do would act or would be in a general manner
<< page >>
 as
 made possible by the person s given sociohistorical context 35 this person
 would for example likely always have a mobile phone on hand or near at hand
 and it would be activated to receive incoming calls and texts moreover the
 person might very well be inclined to use her or his device to search the
 internet in peircean terms habit functions at the level of the logical
 interpretant it enacts a correspondence between an object and its sign e g
 mobile device
<< arrow >>
 connection thus habit is the very condition of signification in order for
 signs to mean something there must be shared habitual interpretations of them
 peirce equates cognition with semiosis which he defines as a species of
 conduct 36 the general manner by which people that is a community of
 interpreters or inquirers arrive at meaning assumes as apel specifies the form
 of a rule embedded in human behavior 37 consider for instance that a great
 many contemporary users rarely if at all remain technologically disconnected
 for extended periods of time because connectivity is an implicitly agreed-upon
 way or style of life we anticipate that others like ourselves are on and
 online we refer to internet searches as googling we agree to be reachable e g
 textable by phone and for many of us this likewise means being linked in to
 social-networking platforms such as facebook and twitter such thinking is a
 shared habit and shared habits are habit forming others likewise will connect
 and be on they too will google they will accept an invitation to be facebook
 friended announce that they are following someone on twitter or otherwise
 share information about themselves and their activities 38 because habit for
 peirce transpires according to general principles that govern possible
 behavior it proceeds according to the conditional mode of the future tense the
 would-be of nascent habitual behavior 39 that is the process of habit is not
 mechanical 40 while there may seem to be an automaticity or regimentation
<< page >>
 at
 work in habit peirce contends that what one fully believes or does today one
 might in fact disbelieve not do tomorrow for example we may or may not log on
 to any one or more social-networking platforms this is because habit is not
 attributable to any cause as such it does not simply proceed according to some
 predetermined or preestablished course of action in response to a stimulus
 rather habit works toward some idea of action based on some desired outcome as
 informed by one s inclination or predisposition it proceeds according to
 actions that have this or that aim 41 but again such actions are never
 definitively prescribed even as repetition or iteration might seem to promise
 consistency of behavior and thereby render habit regular
<< comp pls insert qr01_05 about here >>
 habitual behavior then only ever functions to ensure variability 42 habits are
 relative and therefore subject to influences of context habit understood in
 this manner embraces change although it does not guarantee it neither are the
 tendencies attributable to habit predetermined so while repetition of a
 particular behavior might perpetuate already existing patterns of behavior it
 might very well result in an alteration or change of habitual behavior the
 effects of such change manifest as continued behavior of a different sort and
 according to peirce last until such time as habit change occurs again in other
 words habit and habit change are inextricably linked they are so in the
 moments when the individual as cognitive being is just coming into life in the
 flow of time
<< dcq >>
 or as i will discuss in the next chapter bergsonian duration 43 importantly
 peirce emphasizes that an individual s coming into life in the time of thought
 always occurs in relation to a circle of society 44 this means that habit and
 habit change are necessarily historically specific and socioculturally
 oriented as individuals we do not think act or exist alone rather we acquire
 ways of thinking and doing that are collectively shared and belong
<< page >>
 to social
 life that make sense only in light of a general manner of thinking across a
 population habit change is the guarantee of generality at work across a
 population that is the guarantee of possibility that is ever a condition of
 the potential actualization of some other reality some other habitual behavior
 as made possible at the level of the social as individuals we might very well
 select an unlikely link in a list of more relevant ones this choice might
 alter for example google s pagerank scoring thereby affecting to some small
 degree subsequent habits of thought for many others or we might switch our
 mobile phones to vibrate in order to compromise between a requirement of
 silence and a desire to be connected these shifts occur within the limits of
 possible behavior the limits of possible behavior as such are determined by
 what is sensible to a larger community although peirce attributes a sociality
 to habit and habit change he does not provide an account of how sociality is
 actually situated in the world in his abstraction the concrete aspects of
 physical space the technologies and technological infrastructure that define
 it and the people who inhabit or pass through it go unspecified if habit and
 habit change are social as peirce rightly contends then they of necessity are
 practiced somewhere and according to the constraints of place and time as our
 devices in their time and date stamping and location metadata make so very
 clear we would be wise to consider how material context plays a role in how
 habits take shape for example we have learned to perform certain site-specific
 behaviors we turn mobile phone ringers to silent or vibrate when we enter
 movie theaters we excuse ourselves from the table at a restaurant in order to
 take an important call and we put our computers to sleep if we don t power
 them down when visitors come for dinner at the same time we should recall as
 michel foucault has instructed that the habits we acquire through training and
 practice
<< page >>
 are situated 45 they abide protocols defined by institutions that
 constitute society and are materialized as physical sites and structures we
 learn to inhabit particular places in site-specific ways classrooms medical
 office waiting rooms work spaces queues in grocery stores parking structures
 and even one s own bedroom each of these sites presumes a manner of conduct or
 etiquette specific to it appropriate conduct when normalized operates most
 intensively as disguised habit frequently invisible because naturalized into a
 way of living that spans a population routine everyday practices make smooth
 the various operations and transactions that maintain society even so they
 simultaneously function to locate individuals in the context of mobile devices
 the means whereby management is accomplished are more pervasive we are always
 persons locatable and measurable in real time 46 those of us whose routines
 involve connectivity e g text messaging mobile image sharing posting updates
 e-mailing and googling are placed and therefore locatable by those routines a
 mobile phone in or near at hand activated and in the on position signals one s
 location to cellular towers within range gps coordinates e g mobile phone or
 navigational system come within meters of one s geographical position even an
 ip address places one at a particular computer

 that habits routines and everyday patterns of existence are grounded in the
 physical and social world means that habit change has to work within and on
 social space or a la foucault the milieu among those who have worked on this
 problem lefebvre has perhaps most effectively thought about the relationship
 between spatial habits and spatial habit change 47 in the urban revolution
 lefebvre explains that our everyday uses of space abstract it it is parceled
 into units it is bought sold and exchanged as a consequence we inhabit it
 according to a logic of surplus value it
<< page >>
 is relegated to the status of a
 commodity 48 instead of exploiting space in this manner lefebvre proposes that
 we begin to think of space as a medium but not in the sense that foucault uses
 the term 49 the city serves as his example of such a space he recognizes that
 the city is an urban center and therefore an entity that is administered
 dominated and permeated by networks but he notes that it is also a site for
 movement gathering and assembly 50 for him the features that make a city
 recognizable as such are the very indication of the potential for assembling
 and in ways that boast revolutionary potential its grid of sidewalks streets
 and lights facilitate various routine traversals of space but it also has the
 capacity to inspire unexpected happenings 51 here we might consider flash mob
 events that repurpose public often commercial spaces venues for flash mob
 happenings are typically corporately owned sites frequently the gatherings are
 organized via e-mail or text message a call for an impromptu gathering
 circulates electronically and in response people assemble at a designated site
 such as a shopping mall at a specified time those who have gathered perform
 something unexpected such as a dance or pillow fight before peacefully
 disbanding the event lasts for fewer than ten minutes such events point out
 the normatively routine operations that underpin contemporary socioeconomic
 life by momentarily interrupting them they demonstrate an organizational
 alternative to the necessary and ceaseless circulation of goods money and
 people in the process they make apparent the ways in which we have been
 habituated as workers and consumers of among other goods and services the very
 technologies that make flash mob practices possible without necessarily
 intending to do so flash mob practice implicitly comments on the rote
 character of consumption but it is not political in the sense of hoping to
 redistribute power or somehow slow corporate or individual pursuits of wealth
 as bill wasik the person who initiated the first flash mob event describes it
 flash
<< page >>
 mobs perform the act of coming together especially in an era of
 social-networking platforms such as facebook and twitter where social
 interaction is frequently just virtual 52 he comments that flash mobs
 demonstrate what social media technologies and social networks are capable of
 they bring people together lurking in wasik s claim is one common way of
 thinking about technologies especially mobile technologies this perspective
 offers us an optimistic or hopeful vision of community that allays fears about
 antisocial behavior or isolation wasik s picture of flash mob togetherness
 also wards off threats of political contest and potential social degeneration
 having identified pervasive consumerism as a problem wasik s proposition
 contains it by redirecting substantive critique things can continue as usual
 and do once a group of flash mobbers exits the scene of shopping mall or
 department store a different mob mentality emphasizes a more agonistic
 democratizing energy inspiring rallies and protests howard rheingold was an
 early champion of this model in 2002 he intimated that mobile technologies are
 productive of spontaneous collectives or smart mobs 53 smart mobs as described
 by rheingold demonstrate the potential political power of increased
 coordination and cooperation among people worldwide especially youths the
 rheingoldian mobile many in swarming the public square portends the overturn
 of the status quo but without acknowledging how those so-mobilized are also
 trackable in this way rheingold s model has something in common with wasik s
 both neglect the poignant fact that digital networked mobile and almost always
 on technologies place individuals on grid and always in relation to a larger
 population albeit in different ways flash mobs and smart mobs vastly
 underestimate the significance of the fact that individuals who compose them
 are always already constituted as part of a population in the biopolitical
 sense augusta app is a response to this assumption it understands that

<< page >>
 technologies like the google search habituate us to perpetuate the status quo
 we inhabit everyday routines that extend to mobile networked devices and our
 uses of them in the process we often fail to see that the infrastructure that
 allows us to connect also requires us to connect in some ways rather than
 others even as we curse dropped calls and other inadequacies in our cellular
 service we often forget that we are always on grid and trackable at the same
 time we take being locatable as a matter of course we ourselves expect to be
 able to locate persons places and things with the touch of a button or a pinch
 or swipe of a screen thus augusta app recognizes lefebvre s insight about the
 nature of consumer citizens or what he terms inhabitants but it deliberately
 avoids connecting to any particular project of political transformation this
 is because it endeavors to offer participants a laboratory that might be
 useful for investigating the conditions of possibility for any habit change
 whatsoever in our current mediated environment to a remarkable degree our
 political culture continues to understand government in physical terms as
 geographically situated and territorially bounded it is often said that the
 united states is governed from washington d c 54 likewise we persist in
 thinking that our decision making and the responsiveness whereby we are
 governed are a matter of choice in the juridico-legal sense these are both
 habits such habits encourage us to overlook the fact that governance is also a
 matter of administering populations by means of infrastructures that enable
 the continuous monitoring of mobilities wherever they go and of gathering and
 parsing various statistics to imagine an outside to these conditions of being
 on connected and on grid in the twenty-first century would be a mistake if we
 wish to act and be regulated differently that will require peircean habit
 change which transpires at the level of the organism as part of processes of
 cognition of those who inhabit a milieu augusta app aims to contribute to such
 change

 implicates industrial design in a larger biopolitical project design

 our psychic attachments to for example brand platform and carrier the process
 whereby consumers select devices suiting their style and configure them to

 designing for the human hand
<< txt >>
 in the early twenty-first century the iphone epitomized the sophisticated
 methodical and successful effort to provide a tactile interface that feels
 natural and intuitive to all potential users manufactures such as nokia lg and
 samsung which in august 2012 lost a legal battle to apple inc for patent
 infringement also developed this approach without however exemplifying it in
 his macworld keynote address on 9 january 2007 steve jobs introduced the
 iphone by asserting we ve designed something wonderful for your hand it fits
 beautifully in the palm of your hand 3 one might question to whom exactly this
 we refers a good deal of practical labor goes unnoticed in the rhetorical
 sleight of hand whereby the ceo showman offers himself as a metonym for apple
 one might also question what is intended by the words designed for and your
 hand just whose hand is imagined by design processes and to what end in truth
 jobs s wonder implies an unacknowledged assumption that haunts the history of
 industrial design namely that the best interfaces will go unnoticed that they
 will be intuitive and ultimately invisible in striving to fit devices into
 myriad individual hands without calling attention to them as computer
 interfaces apple s industrial design team follows an institutionalized
 practice of forgetting that your hand may be unlike any other insofar as
 industrial designers eagerly seek intuitive relationships between devices and
 hands they simultaneously work to efface the particularities of the very hands
 that hold devices from the beginning apple embraced a design logic that
 communicates approachability and familiarity as paul kunkel explains in
 appledesign the work of the apple industrial design group
<< page >>
 steve jobs as the
 company s cofounder with stephen wozniak and ron wayne demanded that apple s
 products move away from the cold and impersonal corporate aesthetic typical of
 companies such as ibm 4 likewise he disapproved of the wooden boxes other
 companies produced to him they were naive 5 he contended that the personal
 computer ought to look and feel like a real product something that ordinary
 people could use without being confused or intimidated 6 for jobs this meant
 that a pc the apple ii 1977 in particular should boast a slick-looking plastic
 case with soft edges muted colors and a lightly textured surface 7 such
 characteristics would inspire first-time buyers 8 by 1991 apple aspired to
 cater to users cognitive and cerebral demands address users subliminal needs
 and satisfy sensory demands for beauty tactile quality and surprise 9 apple s
 design ethos can be summed up as one of elegant simplicity friendly intuitive
 and sophisticated without being complex 10 apple offers a specific instance
 for considering the historical motivations and corresponding omissions driving
 industrial design practice it should be more widely acknowledged that apple s
 design philosophy develops that of the german company braun in the 1950s and
 60s posting to the popular technology and electronics blog gizmodo in early
 2008 in celebration of the imac s tenth anniversary editor jesus diaz
 identified a direct link between the design philosophies of jonathan ive
 senior vice president of industrial design at apple and dieter rams former
 head of design at braun both men share a commitment to a sparse use of color
 they have similar taste in materials and they both emphasize that function
 ought to determine form diaz concluded that rams is the influence that
 permeates every single product at apple moreover diaz specified at the time
 that rams s ten principles of good design inform the passion for the kind of
 good design that ive advocates when he appears in interviews and promotional
 videos 11
<< page >>
 the design of apple products is not about styling or lifestyle in
 marketing terms according to ive rather it s about humaniz ing technology such
 that persons are inclined to engage 12 on this view a technology s physical
 attributes its identity ought to invite ready understanding and therefore use
 other industrial designers have shared this pursuit of technology that seems
 human friendly because its simplicity and purity rams breeds familiarity ive a
 logic of natural design drives the field according to the broadly influential
 appraisal of engineer donald a norman good design aims to communicate through
 natural signals that facilitate use 13 following this thread ellen lupton
 curator of contemporary design at the cooper-hewitt national design museum and
 her sister julia reinhard lupton assert that a well-designed object diagrams
 its own operation 14 insofar as form makes readily legible how the object
 might be used they point to the twin ideas of affordances and constraints to
 explain how such design operates affordances invite certain kinds of
 interactions and constraints define which set of affordances is available
 their example is a ceramic coffee mug s handle whose shape and placement make
 apparent its use to lift and hang the mug the kind of design norman and the
 luptons advocate heeds according to designer and design theorist victor
 papanek a basic underlying organic principle that allows an object to express
 directly how it should be used 15 in the case of mobile technologies the kind
 of design papanek advocates places hands the goal is to make any hand
 whatsoever respond easily and effortlessly to the device 16 for the iphone
 this principle informs not only how one holds or handles the phone as an
 object but also the way one interacts with its multitouch screen it inspires
 the device s natural user interface nui as well as its shape and size the nui

 manovich notes plays the iphone 17 in identifying the
 interaction as playful manovich calls attention to the rich sensorial and
 often seductive experiences turning interaction into an event something akin
 to theatrical performance 18 this marks a shift from the principally
 utilitarian functionality attributable to jog knobs buttons and keys that
 defined earlier mobile devices as such the iphone allows users first to
 imagine and then to expect a more tactile experience from our mobile
 technologies 19 in the process we grow more attached quite literally to them
<< comp pls insert qr02_02 about here >>
 contemporary mobile devices aspire to fit beautifully in hand but what is
 meant by the hand whose hand and under what circumstances or conditions in the
 case of the iphone and kindred devices the concept of the human hand derives
 in no small part from ergonomic studies and associated biomechanics which
 measure hands in order to produce a paradigm that generalizes particulars both
 ergonomics and biomechanics examine individual bodies in order to explain the
 workings of the human body as a mathematical ideal for example biomechanics
 interprets the flexing of myriad individuals fingers in terms of the
 logarithmic spiral also found in the accretive shell of the chambered nautilus
 20 such interpretation accomplishes thinking about the body as unmarked and
 generic abstracted into specific proportions on which calculations may operate
 this kind of rationalist procedure produces a nature that need not correspond
 to any empirical instance while simultaneously describing all instances it
 creates a norm in relation to which all particulars can be arrayed according
 to their degree of deviance 21 for example many handhelds especially those
 predating the iphone emphasized one-handed operation this tended to mean
 left-handed operation right-handedness was treated as the norm designers
 placed jog knobs and dials within easy reach of the left thumb to free the
 right hand for other tasks the disciplines of ergonomics and biomechanics

<< page >>
 validate such normative judgments and give industrial designers far more
 precise information about the hand than the notion of left-right dominance
 take apple s iphone 5 for instance measuring 4 87 inches by 2 31 inches by 0
 30 inches with a weight of 3 95 ounces i e just under a quarter of a pound
 this most recent iteration of the iphone line assumes a young adult hand with
 digits slender and agile enough to interact with the buttons and keys that
 mobilize content on the multitouch screen itself measuring 4 0 inches on the
 diagonal apple assumes this normal hand belongs to a consumer who can afford
 to purchase such a device and maintain a service contract that charges monthly
 fees 22 as research in fields such as work environment studies and industrial
 health make clear design s approach to the hand is not uncommon a
 representative instance suggests how hands are conceptualized beyond explicit
 interests of commercial retail writing in 1992 bryan buchholz and thomas
 armstrong asserted the need for a predictive model of the hand that would deal
 with all the segments of the hand together as a kinematic-link system 23
 whereas previous approaches had proved useful for comparing normal hand
 function to abnormal hand function what industry needed was a model that would
 enable designers to improve industrial tools that require power grasp tasks
 such as those involving levers their objective was to manufacture hand tools
 that would minimize muscular effort and maximize grip strength to increase
 efficiency of production
<< dcq >>
 and by implication to reduce risk of injury and related fiscal repercussions
 their model intended to measure the grip strength capabilities of the work
 population to evaluate the sensitivity of their mathematical model they tested
 six subjects three men and three women each subject was directed to hold
 variously sized circular cylinders according to two different power grasps in
 order have statistics for a

 representative population hands were chosen so
 that the range of hand length was covered from first percentile female to
 ninety-fifth percentile male 24 the degree of statistical generalization at
 work in this discussion of outcomes is notable even as the authors critique
 certain methods that fail to measure the work population effectively they
 themselves reduce that population to a select and presumably characteristic
 set of attributes built from samples and generalizations design takes sides it
 is never neutral its nature points to a long-standing multidisciplinary
 project of instituting universals this is a biopolitical imperative always a
 process of inscribed socialization design s work extends well beyond the point
 of inception manufacture and purchase for it continues at the site of
 articulation between human and nonhuman entities science and technology
 studies sts and actor-network theory ant have both encouraged us to keep in
 mind that practices such as design provide for new arrangements of people and
 things and therefore reproduce and rearticulate power relations as sociologist
 of technology madeleine akrich explains new technologies can generate and
 naturalize new forms and orders of causality and indeed new forms of knowledge
 about the world 25 likewise technohumanist anne balsamo argues that design
 does not simply produce novel devices and solutions it is also responsible for
 re producing cultural understandings at every turn 26 in other words designers
 of new technologies participate in projects of social norming ethical
 valuation and distribution of power across populations of user consumers we
 might recall the familiar example of this process from actor-network theory
 the hinged door 27 bruno latour offers a descriptive account of how the hinged
 door as a sociocultural object and construct functions both to condition
 people in the ways of entering and exiting buildings and to designate a
 process of information management whereby what gets in and out is determined
 and regulated only in the event that the door itself
<< page >>
 proves insufficient to
 train those who come and go is it necessary to provide a delegated human
 character a doorman or like figure to perform the task in the instance of that
 kind of delegation the door-human ensemble establishes a set of social
 relations that differentiates between those who come and go and the one who
 tends the door we enter and exit buildings routinely without particularly
 noticing the doors or even any one person who may work to ensure our passage
 we notice when inconvenienced when a door doesn t work works poorly has been
 unexpectedly locked or left untended only then might we begin to realize the
 hinged door s awesome agency although more typically we might perceive not the
 door s regulatory power but its limitation of our own movement and will design
 often absents the agency of the objects it creates and thereby naturalizes
 power relations

 jobs s pronouncement of a beautiful fit provides a case in point as we have
 seen the beauty of the fit presupposes fitness a conception of the healthy
 normal hand such norms both allow design to do its work and manage populations
 in a biopolitical sense by defining some hands and user experiences as deviant
 outliers at the same time though the biopolitical project that design
 facilitates is not a static process both akrich and balsamo indicate that new
 arrangements new formulations and new assemblages are possible which produce
 revised or different modes of knowing and relating to the world and each other
 28 governance always exists in tension with how people inhabit their
 environment including their technologies and so we can admit that precisely
 because they work biopolitically designers really do understand something
 about human bodies because design does not impose its model of the hand from
 above but rather develops it from experimental contact with particular hands
 this holding a well-designed object such as an iphone in one s hand may have
 unpredictable consequences design has an account of this too writing in 1999
 paul kunkel offers a compelling elaboration
<< page >>
 of the quality jobs designates a
 beautiful fit in his discussion of the sony design center he explains that
 sony designers strive to elicit unconscious play
<< ap >>
 that is a kind of contact wherein fingers continue to engage the surfaces and
 dials of a device well after a desired function has been performed 29 the sony
 discman predecessor to the ipod and iphone and descendant of the sony walkman
 provides one pertinent example according to kunkel the discman invites a
 relationship of integration which he explains is a hallmark of today s sports
 and lifestyle designs 30 which foreground and facilitate mobility because of
 their being compact and lightweight that is portable unlike electronics of the
 1980s which were conceived as high-tech prosthetic devices artificial
 appendages that allowed the user to greet the world as a champion today s
 devices are about instantiating fusion the distinction can be thought of in
 terms of the degree of interaction between body and device as a movement from
 attachment to integration in this regard alexandra schneider s assessment that
 iphone s screen is rather like a skin has particular relevance 31 by design
 the iphone s surface requires touch as schneider explains the iphone registers
 my every touch in its specific degree direction and expressiveness 32 this
 idea of human-device interaction as skin-on-skin contact discloses something
 profound about ourselves as well as our devices anatomically speaking skin is
 the site of interface par excellence as ellen lupton explains in skin surface
 substance and design 33 not only is it precisely where the body comes into
 contact with the world and its objects but it is also where the body in its
 sloughing becomes part of the materiality of the world it encloses life and
 becomes dead matter similarly our designed objects boast industrial skins that
 enclose a depth density and complexity of substance that equip them with their
 own identity and behaviors they achieve a life of their own the seeming
 autonomy of the device is a function of interaction
<< page >>
 it lives for me thanks to
 the skin-like character of design materials that ensures responsive contact
 between hand and device finger hand and wrist muscles synergistically flex and
 extend abduct and adduct in response to this tactility hand and device live
 fluidly and in concert the experience of integration that the sony discman and
 its successors are designed to elicit is similar to what neurologist frank r
 wilson has called a becoming one 34 working with musicians puppeteers and
 machine operators wilson has had experience with attending to and assessing a
 variety of hand-device relations he describes becoming one as an experience of
 bonding between a person specifically a person s hand and a tool or device
 this bonding produces a mystical feel that arises out of a combination of a
 good mechanical marriage and something in the nervous system 35 wilson
 describes the mystical feel of becoming one as entailing a certain intimacy
 and communication which resonates with what industrial designers and design
 engineers and theorists such as norman recognize as the result of good design
 to this end designers seek material combinations that bring textures shapes
 and heft to handheld devices to encourage continuous holding and not simply
 portability as in the case of amateur film equipment when successful this
 effort results in a nonconscious bonding a kind of relation that is not aware
 as such but neither is it repressed or unconscious insofar as our handheld
 devices are more often than not equipped with network capabilities and gps
 their being in hand means that we are on grid

 i call in-relation the kind of engagement between hand and device to which
 good design aspires a responsive relationship it is not invested in any
 objective or rational outcome and it does
<< page >>
 not aim for utilitarian
 functionality even as it may sell phones like elizabeth grosz s acquaintance
 which she first elaborated in architecture from the outside it refers to an
 intimate apprehension and interconnectivity among people and technologies 36
 in the case of smartphones especially it is easy to see commercial motives
 behind cultivation of the hand-device relationship profit models involve
 selling devices and encourage running up the meter on call time and data
 transfers while it might be appealing to think of personal attachment to our
 devices as somehow counter to commercial imperatives because we regard them as
 in excess of them in truth design efforts establish such attachment as a
 condition of possibility for continued capitalist relations nonetheless the
 experience of acquaintance that grosz describes speaks to something
 supplemental that accounts for the deeply personal attachments people exhibit
 toward their devices and that jobs refers to as a beautiful fit in-relation
 transpires as an intuitive process in the temporal register of duration as
 posited by henri bergson 37 bergson explains perception as a cognitive process
 that unfolds across matter and memory current thinking in neurophysiology
 confirms and extends bergson s insight and allows me to elaborate how bodies
 live this condition of in-relation to mobile devices 38 drawing on antonio
 damasio specifically i refocus the discussion of duration that is the
 temporality of movement and becoming of matter in a hybrid formulation of
 philosophy and science which refuses to privilege the metaphysical and its
 abstractions to consider a concrete historical instance of being in-relation
 requires an analysis of particular conventions and habits of interaction to
 enable that analysis i extend the discussion of philosophy and science in the
 next section to include the semiotic of charles sanders peirce in the process
 i offer an account of how we might better interpret the cultural artifacts

 mobile updates and posts and so forth
 that circulate as a consequence of our being in relation to mobile
 technologies that are always presumably connected broadly bergson s
 philosophical perspective argues against a mechanistic view of existence in
 creative evolution he aligns such a view with a determinism that refuses the
 creative vitality of the living world to which we belong a world that includes
 technologies of various sorts for him such a perspective assumes matter to be
 something inert something to be divided and used for instrumental purposes it
 negates our own relation to the material world it causes us to abstract
 ourselves from the inner becoming of things 39 instead he explains that we
 need to return to a mode of sympathetic communication with that which
 surrounds us such that we might reengage with the living principle and thereby
 experience its creative potential by living principle bergson is not
 suggesting any sort of transcendental omnipotent and omniscient force or
 entity rather he is referring to the continuous dynamic ephemeral generativity
 of all matter all life 40 importantly his is not a metaphysics that finds an
 ideal force outside of matter rather he understands force to coincide with
 matter bergson offers a more particular conception of the body that is
 relevant for thinking of the body in relation this appears early in his oeuvre
 in matter and memory he explicitly describes the body as an image among images
 it is an image that affects and is affected by the aggregate of images that
 constitutes the material world 41 here image does not mean picture or
 representation but refers rather to the kind of interaction commonly
 understood as sensory perception wherein no subject-object distinction
 pertains an image stands in for matter but in a manner that is neither a
 representing it nor a being it it is that which is less than a thing in that
 its ontology is momentary and unstable but more than a representation in that
 it is not a readily legible and falsifiable
<< page >>
 iconic or symbolic abstraction
 although i will argue in a few pages that it functions as an index in the
 peircean sense 42 as a philosophical term then image acknowledges the
 impossibility of our ever really knowing an object as such for in our
 relations with the material world we only ever have access to our perceptions
 of that which we find there 43
<< comp pls insert qr02_04 about here >>
 bergson understands perception to be a matter of images or more specifically a
 system of images that is conditioned according to the particularities of a
 certain privileged image my body 44 later we will see that this accords with
 peirce s notion of thought as a sign consciousness is selective it merely has
 access to certain parts and certain aspects of those parts as dictated by our
 needs and functions 45 here we might think in terms that david rodowick uses
 to describe bergsonian perception samplings of a continuous flow rather than a
 series of discrete snapshots 46 perception proceeds as filtering not
 abstracting i e into representation moreover it is not to be understood as
 something we do or execute intentionally or not there is no essential agency
 to be accorded to this consciousness instead perception emerges out of an
 already dynamic networking of images images that exist without having to be
 perceived a process of discernment that is of separating or distinguishing as
 rodowick clarifies perception is subtractive it is cut or isolated i want to
 reiterate the point that while perception for bergson is discerning as
 rodowick explains it does not register as individual snapshots 47 bergson
 explicitly states that it would be misleading to imagine perception to be a
 kind of photographic view of things 48 such an interpretation incorrectly
 presumes a fixed point separated off from the material world from which a
 picture is taken by that special apparatus which is called an organ of
 perception 49 this is precisely the separation of conscious mind and
 supposedly
<< page >>
 inert matter that he rejects bergson regards as specious the notion
 of an anchoring consciousness that separates the person mind from the world
 matter instead he asserts that our perceptions vary with the molecular
 movements of the brain which themselves remain inseparably bound up with the
 material world 50 the body is a center of action that is an ensemble of
 transmissions of movements in relation perception is never an indication of a
 centered and stable subject 51 the body-as-image responds within the aggregate
 of images in a way that is always virtual virtual in this context refers to a
 potentiality that does not have any preimagined or preordained determinants
 nothing is a priori contemporary neurophysiology confirms bergson s early
 insight that perception is not attributable to an already formed coherent and
 self-aware subject in fact his conception of the body-as-image aptly forecasts
 damasio s point that the proto-self happens multiply emerg ing dynamically and
 continuously out of multifarious interacting signals that span varied orders
 of the nervous system 52 as damasio explains nonconscious processes that
 precede consciousness are central to maintaining life of an organism 53
 damasio calls this fundamental level of living the proto-self it is the site
 at which seemingly intelligent and purposeful but not yet conscious behavior
 emanates 54 this covert knowledge of life management while elementary is not
 at all primitive 55 rather the nonconscious proto-self is a coherent
 collection of neural patterns distributed across the brain and its structures
 which map moment by moment the state of the physical structure of the organism
 in its many dimensions 56 bergson s body-as-image which is a site of
 transmission seems to accord readily with damasio s proto-self as the
 first-order representation of current body states that provides the roots for
 the self but is not yet the self as self-aware 57 at this level first-order
 neural patterns do not infer a consciousness attributable to a reflective self
 for the person as
<< page >>
 biological organism has no powers of conscious perception
 and holds no knowledge 58 it is merely a reference point at each point in
 which it is 59 damasio and bergson alike conceptualize human beings as
 essentially unpredictable for damasio the proto-self is not singular static or
 contained neither is the body-as-image for bergson any encounter with a
 stimulus or bergsonian image provokes in the organism a collection of motor
 adjustments required to continue gathering signals about the object as well as
 emotional responses to several aspects of the object 60 the moment at which
 these neurobiological responses to stimuli resonate as something felt there is
 a mapping second-order neural patterns of being in relation which marks the
 beginnings of consciousness the in-relation of body and device when they join
 in the reciprocity of nonconscious play happens here here at the beginnings of
 consciousness the body is only potentially a human subject that might explain
 itself to itself it is not yet autobiographical rather it is the site of what
 damasio calls the core self a sense of self that transpires as an always
 perpetual present minus any personal-historical context as core consciousness
 that involves the formation of neural patterns it is a simple biological
 phenomenon that gives rise again and again to an awareness of being in the
 process it instantiates a core self a core self is a more elaborate sense of
 self which is fundamental to extended consciousness extended consciousness
 orients the person with respect to a personal historical time complete with
 memory images of a lived past and anticipated future extended consciousness
 provides the sense of self to which my body refers it is the condition of
 possibility for the autobiographical self that has so preoccupied the western
 intellectual tradition while the autobiographical self of extended
 consciousness is bounded and continuous and experienced as a unified whole the
 core self is transient a primordial
<< page >>
 feeling 61 that emerges at the very
 threshold that separates being from knowing 62 core consciousness opens onto
 what damasio describes as a nonverbal or imaged knowing it is a knowing that
 cannot yet be spoken as i for it is without language without reason and is
 anterior to processes of inference and interpretation when one encounters an
 object whether actual e g handheld device or recalled e g thoughts of some
 handheld device or other the brain forms images or mental patterns of the
 object and those images affect the state of the organism i e the proto-self
 where emotion transpires at another level of brain structure a nonverbal
 accounting of these events takes place this second-order neural mapping
 effects a feeling or sense of knowing it is the sense of self that informs the
 mind nonverbally of the very existence of the individual organism in which
 that mind is unfolding and of the fact that the organism is engaged in
 interacting with particular objects within itself or in its surroundings 63 in
 this state as media-culture theorist brian massumi explains one experiences a
 thinking-feeling of what happens in the time of its happening 64 it is the
 moment of integration a la kunkel and the experience of jobs s beautiful fit
 as produced through the natural that good design espouses bergson and damasio
 provide a means of explaining how industrial design works on nature without it
 itself becoming nature all told industrial design in the context of
 biophilosophy and neurophysiology helps to explain how design works on nature
 without turning design into nature in this regard reading damasio and bergson
 together allows us to move beyond the normative strictures of industrial
 design to conceptualize the kind of vitality i attribute to the condition of
 in-relation active and always unfolding in-relation assumes the rhythm and
 time of a present that is always becoming never still in bergsonian terms this
 is the condition of duration which
<< page >>
 damasio explains as a resonant loop wherein
 body states as mediations of the body s direct contact with its surroundings
 and brain mapping become virtually fused 65 it is lived as a subtle flow
 rather than discrete instances of knowing attributable to an already
 constituted subjective perspective 66 this aspect of core consciousness which
 is the becoming of my present is a gentle and persistent awareness of being
 not a concerted and definitive self-awareness an experience of awareness of a
 here and now which is only ever here and now at each moment my body-as-image
 and in-relation meets with contingency at the point where the past bleeds into
 the future in the moment of my present 67 at moments i experience my present
 poignantly as it happens to me and through me as a site of mediation between
 some now and some number of thens and in the context of what might be
 involuntary this becoming is experienced materially temporally that is vitally
 as shock walter benjamin 68 or deja vu or a flooding of recognition a la
 proust s madeleines or the delightful perhaps even comforting feel of a
 well-designed device in hand damasio and bergson describe nature differently
 than does industrial design in tandem they help us understand our relations
 with our mobile devices as potentially open and variable even if in the
 process they explain how such a process can be normalizing consequently we
 become equipped to locate a complex transaction between hand and device that
 explains why industrial design works the way it does and in terms that
 industrial design itself cannot supply it is in this discursive space that i
 locate the potential that in-relation might ultimately afford a potential for
 habit change

 design
 which has sustained interaction between hand and device as a primary goal
 kodak likely shared this objective but its four-pound kodak cine k home movie
 camera cannot have satisfied it to the same degree as do early
 twentieth-century devices 69 through its difference as a kind of mobile media
 practice nixon s home movie calls attention to particularities of our present
 that result from more beautiful fits between hand and device handheld on and
 connected mobile technologies are productive of cultural practices that
 evidence new ways of being in the world handheld devices encourage new habits
 of sharing unheard of until the last decade of the twentieth century for
 example texting and related forms of mobile updating had become ubiquitous in
 much of the world by the end of the first decade of the twenty-first century
 moreover as cultural anthropologist mizuko ito explained early on regarding
 camera phone culture a camera phone in hand encourages persistent alertness or
 more precisely a new kind of personal awareness 70 a wide variety of people
 demonstrate a tendency to image anything whatsoever more immediately and less
 deliberately than was likely the norm for most of the twentieth century 71
<< comp pls insert qr02_05 about here >>
 neurophysiology thickens our understanding of the heightened attentiveness
 that ito describes device in hand a person encounters her surroundings then
 something beyond the device in hand what damasio would call a causative object
 strikes a perceptual chord 72 at such moments the object out there just beyond
 the handheld screen is set out from less-fortunate objects it is selected as a
 particular occasion 73 it is attended to this more focused attention engenders
 a more poignantly felt awareness a deeper sense of knowing and in addition to
 greater alertness sharper focus and higher quality image processing damasio
 explains that this state of increased knowing awareness forms the basis for
 simple nonverbal
 inferences which strengthen the process of core consciousness
 74 these nonverbal
<< page >>
 inferences the result of the close linkage between the
 regulation of life and the processing of images initiate a sense of personal
 perspective which is the condition of possibility for ownership whereby one
 claims one s perceptual images as one s own in the process of for example
 mobile imaging 75 in being able to own one s images one arrives at a sense of
 action and subsequently a sense of agency it is precisely in this moment of an
 intensified sense of knowing and a newly instantiated sense of personal
 perspective and agency that the impulse to text image or post an update
 emerges 76 such an impulse transpires in a moment just prior to the utterance
 of an autobiographical self when the organism as such predominates because of
 its feel a mobile device in hand encourages such responsiveness perhaps more
 than it does any intentional studious approach to communication hands and eyes
 operate in tandem the brain engages in analogous processes simultaneously
 treating the sensitive portions of both the fingers and the retina in
 comparable fashion 77 surfacing above the continuous neurobiological
 processing of images mobile imaging and related behaviors can be understood as
 a response enacted in a here and now by a transient core self whose body is
 almost always on the go 78 while it is certainly possible to use these devices
 with deliberate forethought or simply as smaller versions of nixon s camera by
 design they encourage a new kind of engagement it happens on the edge of
 things on the edge of consciousness and amidst the many edges that structure
 our physical world to the degree that texts mobile updates and images are
 responses of core consciousness rather than or in addition to being
 autobiographical gestures we might interpret the sundry artifacts so produced
 as material traces of a way of being in relation with the world around us in
 their various streamings such artifacts provide evidence of a particular
 encounter as made possible by a reciprocal
<< page >>
 relation between hand and device
 even as they might simultaneously register us with respect to some population
 or other as such they point to the having-been of a particular moment and
 manner of perception which may have been distracted or multitasked even when
 it seems to be autobiographical 79 dispersed across multiple planes of
 interest this kind of attention frequently fails to define or frame the kind
 of subject recorded by such practices as photography home movies scrapbooking
 or journaling as an example we might think of the appearance of spontaneity
 characteristic of a series of mobile imaging thumbnails such sets often
 suggest haphazardness through canted framing and blurry focus similarly the
 selfie is a practice of self-portraiture that frequently includes in frame the
 arm of the one who is self-imaging in contrast the images typically found in
 family photo albums tourist scrapbooks and home movies bespeak more deliberate
 selections of what to frame how to frame it and of which images to retain over
 time 80 cut off from the moment of perception out of which they originate 81
 thumbnail images text messages mobile updates and so forth tend to present or
 gesture toward a self in the process of becoming autobiographical but a self
 that does not yet speak an explicitly autobiographical i 82 remnants of
 neurophysiological processes in their happening these artifacts are indexes
 that is they are actually signs of what it means to be a living organism they
 offer proof of life anterior to self-consciousness consequently they present
 us with a semiotic problem of the kind described by charles sanders peirce
 according to peirce life is a matter of sign relations 83 because we are in
 thought and not the other way around i e thought is not in any one of us
 existence is always an interpretive process he goes on to emphasize that
 thinking happens as a process of relation at no one instant in my state of
 mind is there cognition
<< page >>
 or representation but in the relation of my states of
 mind at different instants there is 84 for him meaning arises as a consequence
 of how this thought may be connected with in representation by subsequent
 thoughts so that the meaning of a thought is altogether virtual 85 peirce s
 virtual has a lot in common with bergson s insofar as there is no prescriptive
 or predetermined outcome of thought and its meaning at each moment thought
 transpires as an event experienced as mere feeling it has no meaning in and of
 itself only the material quality of a representation a mental sign thought is
 not yet representation 86
<< comp pls insert qr02_06 about here >>
 at the same time there is no feeling that a person experiences that is not
 also a representation a predicate of something determined logically by the
 feelings cognitions which precede it 87 in this way every feeling e g
 sensation emotion and passion is an act of thinking cognition intellectual
 value only surfaces in relation to how any one thought may be connected with
 in representation by subsequent thoughts 88 which is what makes them
 representable for example by language picture or gesture in the moment of
 texting imaging or posting an update from a handheld device we do not simply
 produce signs that is representations we first and foremost materialize our
 feeling our thinking thereby actualizing ourselves as signs this is not
 dissimilar to bergson s my-body as an image among images or damasio s
 proto-self whose first-order neural patterns open onto core consciousness this
 comparison across the fields of neuroscience philosophy and semiotics acquires
 greater resonance given the trope peirce uses to characterize the nature of
 thought he explains that each thought-sign translates or interprets a previous
 one such that thought runs in a continuous stream through our lives 89 the
 continuous stream that is immediate consciousness undergoes continuous
 mediation as one thought-sign affects shapes and informs
<< page >>
 another inexplicable
 at the level of autobiographical being this ongoing process is the real
 effective force behind consciousness 90 constitutive of the continuity of it
 consciousness 91 it is temporal in the manner of bergsonian duration and
 damasio s perpetual present of core consciousness moreover peirce describes
 again in terms reminiscent of bergson and damasio how the striking in of a new
 experience is never an instantaneous affair but is an event occupying time and
 coming to pass by a continuous process 92 like the unfolding or ripening that
 bergson attributes to perception and the something felt that damasio
 associates with the beginnings of consciousness peirce s description of
 cognition emphasizes the durational quality of thought 93 ultimately peirce
 posits that cognition is a ceaseless process of interpretation each thought is
 always interpreted by a subsequent thought which likewise suggests something
 to the thought which follows it 94 text messaging mobile imaging and mobile
 updates are kinds of interpretative action in registering acts or events of
 core consciousness they are signs of a physiological process and what remains
 of these acts or events the texts the images and the updates gives digital
 signature or autograph to a having-been present of cognition at a particular
 time in a particular place from a peircean standpoint then such artifacts are
 functionally prospective and retrospective requiring both future
 interpretation and recognition of a combination of already existing
 interpretive possibilities as a consequence of past interpretations we do not
 live outside of this process of semiosis what s more we do not live semiosis
 in isolation as mentioned in chapter 1 and as i will elaborate in chapter 3 a
 sign is a medium of communication this means that semiosis is social it
 transpires in relation to a larger interpretive community cultural concepts
 conveyed by neologisms such as googling pinching and friending demonstrate the
 social character of semiotic behavior
<< page >>
 in the era of social networking such
 concepts circulate horizontally by means of interactions among individuals who
 are in the habit of practicing facebooking tweeting 95 texting and mms-ing
 among a variety of social-networking engagements as a way of life cultural
 concepts evolve as and through the practices and language that characterize
 particular styles or habits of living and communicating 96 we tend to carry
 our mobile technologies in hand or at least on our persons or within close
 reach and we use acronyms and abbreviations to expedite our text-oriented
 exchanges these practices bind us together in an interpretative community that
 extends beyond the particular individuals involved in semiotic transactions in
 peircean terms cultural concepts demonstrate a wonderfully perfect kind of
 sign-functioning 97 which involves a community of minds being at one with each
 other because they are in relation to each other this condition is
 constitutive of a sort of collective mind one that delimits population 98
 latourian interpretation encourages a recognition that the collective mind
 evolves over time as part of technological assemblages thinking that knows for
 example how to approach hinged doors differently than sliding sensored ones
 exhibits such transformation in the same way the mobile device as a
 convergence of telephone computer internet camera and audio player among other
 devices is necessarily a product of a shift or change in some previous routine
 or habit of thinking change is sure to occur again to figure this out we need
 to understand the device as human-machine assemblage in the way latour and
 other actor-network theorists see it being in relation with a mobile device
 opens onto semiotic habits that are not readily explained in terms of what i
 choose to do with my phone rather the terms we ought to be using are what my
 phone and i do together industrial design interprets the human-device
 relationship otherwise while it eagerly measures and normalizes bodies it
 ultimately
<< page >>
 conceives the devices it develops as useful and aesthetically
 pleasing for potential consumer users it abstracts the body from the
 individual in order to work on the device as if it were an autonomous thing
 moreover it does not particularly concern itself with how this design approach
 regulates individuals by establishing norms encouraging some activities while
 discouraging others defining some bodies as aberrant and so on less concerned
 with subjects and subjectivity than for example retailers content providers
 and analysts industrial design continuously registers and evaluates multiply
 proliferating statistics to optimize size shape and heft for the target market
 in constellation peirce bergson and damasio provide an alternative means of
 considering subjectivity as it is in relation to a mobile networked device
 they invite us to understand that each of us is the consequence of ongoing
 impulses synapses thumbnail images tweets and other forms of sign production
 insofar as handheld technologies such as iphones proliferate various data they
 offer a concrete point of departure for understanding persons as ongoing
 articulations of signals that is pulsings of core consciousness text messages
 mobile imaging thumbnails and other mobile updates register us as locatable
 and readily subject to various techniques of assessment these practices also
 stream an autography what i will refer to in the next chapter as expressivity
 that precisely because it is semiotic habit also involves habit change read
 together peirce bergson damasio and latour underscore that change will be a
 largely nonconscious process that occurs in relation to our technological
 devices

 contemporary image-sharing practices that make use of keyword tags provide an
 excellent opportunity to observe the interaction of conscious choices
 nonconscious habits and technological mediations that make persons places and
 things findable scott nixon s the augustas reel allows us to contextualize
 these current trends in social networking within a longer history of
 technology-enabled practices of self-recording the social-networking platforms
 and tools i consider in this chapter are those suggested by the moment of
 writing a decade ago one would have written about myspace rather than facebook
 twitter instagram youtube and vimeo this field of practice is rapidly evolving
 nonetheless it remains possible to discern some common problems contemporary
 practices share with celluloid home movies and with the forms of sharing
 likely to follow them central among these problems is the issue of image-label
 relationships the very labels that enable finding and locating may very well
 frustrate findability and by extension accessibility charles sanders peirce s
 triadic theory of the sign which distinguishes between icon index and symbol
 provides a vocabulary with which to understand this issue recall that for
 peirce an icon
<< page >>
 is representational it signifies by means of likeness or
 verisimilitude in contrast a symbol conforms to rules and conventions that
 establish the conditions that make signification possible there is no natural
 or intuitive relation between for example a word and its referent as for an
 index it manifests meaning materially either as a physical trace a fingerprint
 or photograph or a real-time indication of some event the wind s direction
 moreover any kind of sign requires another sign a thought-sign to interpret it
 to become meaningful icons symbols and indices must interpret each other
 peirce s semiotic emphasizes that symbolic labels have no inherent capacity to
 fix that is stabilize or secure the iconic and indexical unruliness of the
 photographic documentary image only through habitual usage does the fact that
 an image bears a place name suffice to map it if findability is a central
 technique of governance then we can expect its operations to be both habit
 dependent and open to habit change

 in the last chapter i concluded by positing that the streams of data we
 disseminate by means of our mobile devices constitute an autography not an
 autobiography we who have been brought up in liberal nation-states might
 readily transpose the former autography into the latter autobiography
 furthermore we might characterize such autobiographical practice as belonging
 to the province of self-expression which we assume to be personal and
 essential we typically understand ourselves as individuals who may decide or
 not to document where we have been and what we have done we tend to understand
 such practice as boasting a style or voice particular to us for this reason it
 makes sense to interpret a collection of home movies as expressive of a
 particular individual for example a man named scott nixon we
<< page >>
 rely on an
 assumption that we express ourselves as self-aware individuals through the
 artifacts we produce be they images we collect or narratives we craft we
 rarely if at all consider that documenting ourselves and our movements helps
 others to regulate us and the populations to which we belong michel foucault
 taught us to question and historicize this common sense when he identified a
 tradition of disciplinary practice that requires speaking the self 1
 always-in-hand mobile devices extend and alter that tradition not only is
 self-expression not outside techniques of governance but also it is not
 entirely or even primarily a function of individual will after all as i showed
 in the previous chapter much of what we document of ourselves transpires at
 the nonconscious level of the proto-self damasio at the level of impulse
 nevertheless we tend to think of ourselves as self-conscious
 autobiographically inclined individuals thus even at this late date it can
 still seem news that information technologies facilitate the management of
 persons within and across populations in march of 2011 the new york times
 reported of the ordinary cell phone it s tracking your every move and you may
 not even know it 2 although cell phone companies rarely divulge how much
 information they collect they are clearly in the business of tracking their
 customers whereabouts by means of their devices this requires a sophisticated
 and highly integrated infrastructure and likely recourse to some heuristic
 oriented or related to the traveling salesman problem to route calls
 efficiently cell phone companies must be able to locate any active phone at
 any moment for billing purposes they register and record where incoming calls
 originate and their duration numbers of text messages and the volume of data
 traffic for phones equipped to process it any time a cell phone is in the on
 position it signals information which cell phone companies record this record
 provides a resource for law enforcement agencies and marketing firms alike

 networks a company whose website s home page proclaims indexing the real world
 using location data for predictive analysis 3 the company has developed a
 state-of-the-art method for parsing large quantities of data to provide
 remarkable real-time insight into aggregate human activity trends that is it
 identifies patterns of usage and movement within populations the method
 registers behavioral data movement trails and traffic density in order to find
 points of similarity and relation 4 one of the outcomes of at&t s work with

 the overall activity level of a given city given a person s habits of movement
 the application identifies hot spot locations that may interest this person
 based on pattern matching with like activity of numerous other persons in the
 vicinity importantly the application does not care about content it only cares
 about patterns in other words citysense is not interested in what kinds of
 places a person likes or what that person does while there it simply registers
 where the person goes and how frequently it calculates the individual s
 presence or frequency of presence at particular sites and makes
 recommendations by computing those sites that might be similar based on the
 habits of presence of numerous others that citysense along with other
 smartphone applications is interested in where-ness should not be a surprise
 after all we have been documenting our whereabouts for quite some time maps of
 all sorts to be sure but also family albums tourist photographs
 nineteenth-century cartes de visite and of course such films as nixon s the
 augustas attest to this inclination it matters that one has been there that
 one has been present at a particular place location and place matter it s
 important that we ve been someplace or that we will be somewhere this means
 something and applications
<< page >>
 like citysense make this apparent even as they
 confront us with another reality our desires to place ourselves i e speak or
 document where we have been when and how implicate us in a broader
 biopolitical project in this case the ability to make patterns predictable
 would seem to have many uses among these are not surprisingly emergency
 response protocols and staffing in vicinities where a greater number of
 vehicular events occur there might be a greater proportion of emergency
 response personnel on shift we might think this is to our advantage in the
 meantime our intentional or unintentional investments in autographical
 practice coincide with and indeed facilitate governance what the citysense
 example reveals is a pervasive concern for findability where findability
 designates a complementary relation between locatability i e identification of
 place and navigability i e mobility 5 importantly findability is not simply
 about specifying a stable and stationary position or location rather as peter
 morville explains findability names the capacity to access and recombine data
 about location such that shifting patterns of movement can be identified and
 even anticipated it refers to an ability to manage shifting relations among
 multiple entities be these persons things or ideas within a particular context
 or milieu in the case of mobile devices user practices enhance findability
 these devices encourage self-documentation in the form impromptu personal
 updates via sms and mms and social-networking platforms in addition to the
 automatic recording of time and location data of which the user may not be
 conscious 6 time- and location-stamped copies or voice messages images links
 texts documents and e-mails also accumulate in ways that are not visible to
 most users producing an ever-accreting record of the shifting relations among
 digital objects as they traverse a range of storage media hard drive flash
 drive cloud and mobile phone and various digital networks persons located and
 tracked by means of

<< page >>
 such traces cannot be said either to control their
 findability or to represent it peirce s semiotic establishes that the
 expressivity attributable to self-recording whether conscious or not is
 ultimately a question of social habit while we might map tendencies and
 patterns these are not expressive of an autobiographical self in the way that
 cartesian subjectivity purports one may not be explicitly cognizant of the
 fact that one s mobile device is connected nor might one be aware that one s

 social-networking and related internet-oriented practices involve people
 producing and sharing untold quantities of words sounds and images depicting
 themselves and their surroundings by means of texting and updating by
 e-mailing blogging and image sharing by posting comments or reviews to
 websites and by clickstreaming and pinging people proliferate data trails that
 disperse details about personal interests views and habits and in all
 instances reveal data about time and place the emergence of the term life
 caching captures the all-encompassing nature of this kind of project of
 self-record 7 a term that appeared in a 2004 trendwatching com article life

 investing in the project of collecting storing and displaying one s entire
 life understood data accumulation in and of itself as a defining principle and
 desirable outcome 9 the same year witnessed microsoft s sensecam 2004 a
 personal black box of sorts sensecam offers an extreme instance of life
 caching unlike typical imaging devices this badge-sized camera is worn about
 the neck it automatically records up to two thousand images per twelve-hour
 period capturing frames when it detects movement and changes in light
 conditions and temperature when first prototyped it was anticipated that
 future sensecam models would capture heart rate or other physiological data at
 the time microsoft researchers explained the benefits of sensecam it would aid
 memory for example by offering reminders regarding misplaced personal items
 record details regarding accidents enabling emergency technicians to attend to
 injuries more effectively and even lead to greater understanding of ones self
 sic and one s motivations 10 more recently the device now available
 commercially as the vicon revue has been promoted as a memory aid for persons
 suffering from alzheimer s and other memory-sapping diseases the vicon revue
 highlights the extent to which we expect to cache iconic traces images of our
 lives but as many of us know if we don t append our photos with dates names of
 those in frame and place names we will likely struggle later to recognize
 where we were and whom we were with in part the gps stamp is a solution to
 this problem of course facial-recognition software provides a technique for
 remembering those who appear frequently in images snap an image of someone and
 the software recognizes that person

 and generates a label that names her or
 him to which is appended geolocation data but i suggest that scott nixon
 serves as an early specialist in such matters of labeling what he recognizes
 as his film the augustas demonstrates is the significance of the label as such
 and its relation to that which it names implicitly this concern suggests a
 need for timeliness to which the automatic encoding of metadata to mobile
 images provides a twenty-first-century response
<< comp pls insert qr03_02 about here >>
 as described in the introduction nixon s sixteen-minute home movie documents
 no fewer than thirty-six various augustas from across the continental united
 states from the 1930s through the 1950s we assume that much of this travel was
 business related and we know nixon sold insurance a drama of image-place label
 relationships propels the film shots of diverse places are repeatedly labeled
 with some variation of augusta south augusta augusta street etc 11 certainly
 the tendency to mark shots by identifying location suggests a desire to
 catalog for purposes of subsequent recognition and memory as any tourist s
 photo album might do and yet nixon s insistent appreciation of and commitment
 to signs as visual objects exceeds the merely functional requirement of recall
 in this regard the work performed by and through the nixon augustas opens onto
 several currently fundamental concerns regarding the relationship between the
 photographic image and information retrieval concerns informing the creation
 of the metadata through which the content of computerized image files becomes
 searchable 12 on one hand nixon s film underscores a still prevalent
 expectation that there exists a connection between an image and a label that
 places it at the same time it reveals that identifying a place as augusta does
 not suffice to find it because there are multiple augustas any one place might
 very well serve as referent for the signifier augusta in nixon s analog film
 reel the organization of
<< page >>
 images by means of keyword or tag looks like an
 anomalous or at least distinctive device 13 this device becomes a defining
 characteristic of digital mobile imaging streams we assume that keyword tags
 label and thereby place into various categories of likeness a wide array of
 digital content suggestive of a proto-database aesthetic in which information
 is malleable navigable and accessible nixon s compilation of augustas
 forecasts and yet is substantially different from the now prevalent logic
 propelling the proliferating streams of digital thumbnails that accumulate and
 circulate according to the distributed and collaborative pulsings of social
 networking whereas nixon s reel of augustas frequently shows a sign in frame
 that explicitly names an instance of augusta mobile imaging thumbnails as
 accessible via publicly designated social-networking services very rarely
 depict actual signage appellating place in fact the image itself may bear
 little if any apparent association with anything remotely recognizable as
 augusta for example one might search a social-networking site for images
 associated with augusta not case sensitive such a search might very well
 return as did a 2009 facebook search an image of paint-splattered galoshes a
 street corner in brazil or a couple posed in an ardent embrace 14 it is likely
 that in any particular case nothing recognizable as augusta will appear
 anywhere in the mise-en-scene the label may only be a title or tag clicking on
 the keyword in a link-enabled list or tag cloud might very well deliver one to
 another iteration or catalog of augustas at the level of iconic representation
 then any thumbnail image posted to a social-networking site may seem excessive
 of the keyword that functions to identify or name it however the tag serves to
 taxonomize the single thumbnail within a larger cross-platform network of
 statistically related thumbnails the tag augusta affiliates thumbnails as a
 group but does not necessarily
<< page >>
 group places persons or things with that name
 as metadata the keyword tag makes it very easy to find augusta in all its
 multiplicitous and continuously proliferating manifestations at the same time
 it rapidly becomes impossible to understand augusta as a unique location this
 kind of symbolic textual metadata presents an indicative paradox found is
 nowhere that is no place in particular beyond what tagging patterns might
 reveal mobile imaging devices such as camera phones encode location
 information including gps coordinates and gsm cell information from network
 towers which refer then to for instance city and country names 15 this
 information is not simply an extension of keyword tagging gps coordinates and
 so forth do in advance the detective work that the imaginary filing cabinet of
 nixon s film would do to tell us where and when nixon was but even as location
 coordinates and date and time stamps might succeed in determining where-ness
 and a when there s still the contingency of relations between what an image
 shows and the where and when of photo s having been taken as media art and
 photography theorist daniel palmer intimates the representational or iconic
 register of the image despite the promise of indexicality is almost beside the
 point 16 this is because information trumps representation a picture appended
 with metadata becomes less about what it represents than the information it
 carries
<< comp pls insert qr03_03 about here >>
 this both is and is not the case with nixon s the augustas his inclusion of
 the place sign in the image suggests the possibility of recombination in
 relation to an infinite field of information a potentially unquantifiable
 number of augustas populating a catalog once the name augusta becomes a
 catalog index term it offers itself for endless new combinations nonetheless
 the catalog term in the augustas is nearly always part of the iconography of
 the film and thereby acquires an indexical
<< page >>
 status of a second sort although
 the name augusta may not distinguish it the road sign bearing that name still
 specifies that light bounced off a particular sign in a specific place visited
 at a particular moment each such augusta indexes the fact that someone
 presumably scott nixon with camera in hand visited the site and was present at
 the time of filming insofar as the resultant image provides a record of his
 location it also can be said to track him in something like the way our mobile
 imaging devices now do using numerical symbols such as gps coordinates and
 date and time stamps but nixon did not carry a mobile device programmed to
 register indexically and subsequently symbolically location data were one
 disposed to confirm his being at a particular augusta as documented by his
 labeled film frames one would have to match the visual evidence provided by
 the film with a corroborating picture or view as a record of nixon s having
 been in one augusta or another the augustas reveals the workings of the
 panoptic principle which has inspired administrative uses of photography from
 its beginnings in his widely cited article the body and the archive allan
 sekula examines the instrumental potential of the photograph s iconicity 17
 citing foucault s turn to jeremy bentham s panopticon for illustrating the
 functioning of disciplinary society sekula explains that explorations of the
 instrumental potential of photography coincided with the birth of the prison
 18 in its policing capacity the photograph isolates individuates and makes
 visible the criminal body for example facial features and their measure 19
 were used representationally both to demonstrate criminal types and to
 identify individual criminals to this end he notes the influence of francis
 galton and alphonse bertillon whose separate endeavors expose a crisis in
 faith in optical empiricism ultimately the veritable failure of photographic
 portrayal due to its messy contingency and the sheer number of photographs

 amassed necessitated a bureaucratic-clerical-statistical system of
 intelligence
<< ap >>
 the filing cabinet 20 to index a particular criminal by means of iconic
 likeness proved insufficient to the task of policing symbolic information e g
 known names height and weight distinguishing features and last known
 whereabouts was needed to organize the files at work here are peirce s three
 semiotic registers icon index and symbol just as in the case of nixon s
 augustas the augustas and its cousins populating various social-networking
 sites reproduce the form and logic of this police function even when they are
 not used by the police 21 retrospectively nixon s movements may be found out
 and made accountable as augusta app demonstrates to do so effectively however
 requires a better filing or processing system than nixon s own film provides
 one capable of cross-referencing the trips to augustas nixon jumbles together
 with sources that aim to tell them apart by comparing them with other evidence
 once the filing cabinet becomes a database the instrumental functions latent
 in the augustas are vastly expanded on social-networking sites any image might
 explicitly be tagged augusta just as likely however it might bear an inference
 of location by means of tagging patterns in which an algorithm determines the
 degree to which it is related to a keyword such as augusta and by extension a
 place or person or thing so called 22 although they continue a
 nineteenth-century interest in using images to identify and locate individuals
 the metrics produced via mobile technologies notably emphasize site
 specificity technological development increasingly emphasizes biological
 metadata gathering as the sensecam/vicon revue illustrate rather than
 physiognomic measurements of the head face or body in their photographic
 representation these processes function less to fix the identity of any
 individual than to track and anticipate movements
<< page >>
 within the context of a
 milieu as indicated by changes in lighting or other environmental factors a
 fingerprint or dna test will establish identity but contemporary biometric
 initiatives aim to do that swiftly enough to reveal patterns series
 repetitions combinations chunkings juxtapositions across tags geocoordinates
 and time stamps metadata encoded to thumbnail images register persons and
 render them accountable in a specifically time-based way and in a manner not
 unrelated to the emerging technique of thermal scanning at airports we
 therefore become legible not as more or less deviant types or even as
 individually named persons but as patterns of mobility and choice as well as
 degrees of health as measured by body temperature nixon s film and images
 appearing on social-networking sites such as facebook or instagram prompt us
 to distinguish two processes that enable governance 1 identifying and norming
 by means of visibility and 2 locating and predicting by means of tracking if
 for example nixon s images track it is not because of their iconic properties
 which may make visible evidence of some location but because of their
 indexical ones that the photographic image in each instance materializes nixon
 s presence as a chemically preserved trace analogously gps coordinates
 constitute an index-symbolic relation that locates because the numbers point
 back to a phone having been in a particular place and time and because we
 believe that electromagnetic waves striking a receiver can indelibly stamp a
 location into a file while many commentators concerned with the policing
 functions of mobile devices have sought to extend foucault s panopticism to
 explain it the formulation visibility is a trap can obscure a much more
 complex semiotic process involving relations among various types of signs 23
 neglecting this semiotic process can occlude the fact that biopolitical
 governance functions in ways that have very little to do with self-discipline
 as encouraged by explicitly panoptic techniques
<< page >>
 because they act on groups
 that engage shared habits of practice in the next chapter i explore in more
 detail the fact that populations can be made accountable without necessarily
 being made visible in the province of social networking our movements and
 transactions can be monitored and stored on multiple levels simultaneously and
 in near if not real time not only by abstract authorities but also by
 ourselves insofar as metadata provide quantifiable measures such as date time
 and location coordinates they make persons findable as geert lovink explains
 with regard to blogging an early mode of social networking often designated
 web 1 0 today s recordability of situations is such that we are no longer
 upset that computers read all our moves and expressions sound image and text
 and write them into strings of zeros and ones 24 for decades now we have been
 transposing ourselves into metrical code through our transactions with
 computers mostly without noticing it we ceaselessly constitute ourselves as
 calculable in nikolas rose s sense of that term metrical transcoding of the
 person along with the person s every move facilitates the government of
 subjectivity via the management of individual difference 25 insofar as our
 mobile devices boast a variety of analytical features and services as kate
 crawford notes we have opportunities for self-analysis and self-management
 according to various personal social and biophysical environments 26 the more
 we allow our devices to source that is register or record details about our
 behaviors the more richly detailed will be the accounts of our day-to-day
 habits and how such habits evolve 27 at the same time calculability of the
 person is the condition of possibility for the calculability of the social
 sphere in their trackability patterns of use always ensure that persons are
 findable within a population as well as across a territory 28 this is how
 credit card companies detect instances of unusual spending and how citysense
 knows to suggest where one should go next
<< page >>
 those who are findable in this sense
 are not necessarily visible to those doing the finding nor do they necessarily
 see themselves as potentially found out according to the logic of surveillance
 but because the streams of information they disseminate are signs they acquire
 meaning that is legibility through interpretation in the peircean sense
 findability is an interpretive process that renders persons manageable

 locating and tracking expressivity the case of augusta

 i have distinguished between expression understood as a creative act of for
 example deliberate self-narrative and expressivity understood as all
 individuals spontaneous habitual relationship to their surroundings made
 possible by a condition of in-relation to their mobile imaging device this
 difference becomes significant in the context of biopolitical governance to
 see how we can begin by recalling the history of autobiographical practice as
 elaborated by michel foucault foucault proposes that modern governmentality
 makes one s analytical exploration of oneself a central technique he theorizes
 the relation that developed between care of the self and confession when at
 the beginning of the christian era know yourself became a matter of confessing
 oneself completely to a spiritual guide 29 this transition initiated what
 foucault calls the hermeneutics of the self in which the subject began to
 engage in deciphering hidden subjective data and thereby became committed to
 uncovering or excavating some truth located deep in the unconscious or soul
 ultimately a project of self-renunciation confession is the formidable
 injunction to tell what one is and what one does what one recollects and what
 one has forgotten what one is thinking and what one thinks he is not thinking
 30 according to foucault we have since become a singularly confessing society

<< page >>
 one confesses one s crimes one s sins one s thoughts and desires one s
 illnesses and troubles one goes about telling with the greatest precision
 whatever is most difficult to tell 31 such a project was essential to creating
 the self-regulating individuals envisioned by liberal democracies and their
 distinctive penal educational and medical institutions once this disciplinary
 practice moves from the confessional to one s pocket it readily becomes an
 un-self-conscious habit that serves a wide array of administrative goals
<< comp pls insert qr03_04 about here >>
 imagine a person who regularly posts to social-networking services images in
 which the color red figures prominently such an example allows us to contrast
 foucault s understanding of the ever-confessing abstract subjective i in
 encounter with peirce s notion of identity according to peirce identity
 consists in the consistency of what man does and thinks as organism 32
 consistency is physiological because it is of the organism but also it is the
 intellectual character of a thing its way of expressing something 33 in the
 act of expressing something person-organisms insofar as they think express
 themselves the consistency in doing so amounts to identity not only is this
 approach completely counter to the cartesian separation of mind and body but
 it also differs from confessional understandings of self-discipline we need
 not impute a self-conscious decision to emphasize red in order to understand
 that quality of our hypothetical subject s images as simultaneously a form
 self-expression and the result of social training this is because my language
 is the sum total of myself for the man is thought and the organism is only an
 instrument of thought 34 every thought is a sign 35 when we think there is
 present to consciousness something that serves as a sign feeling image or
 conception or inclination because signs may be icons indexes and symbols we
 can amend peirce s point that life is a train of thought 36 the corollary
 might be articulated in this way life is a stream of thumbnails but also

<< page >>
 mobile updates or otherwise shared communiques etc if the word or sign which
 man uses is the man himself then similarly the imaging that man practices is
 likewise the man himself 37 for peirce attention is the power by which thought
 at one time is connected with and made to relate to thought at another time 38
 it is aroused when the same phenomenon presents itself repeatedly on different
 occasions 39 it affects the nervous system such that we come to perform a
 certain act upon every occurrence of the general event to which the particular
 is related as an instance thereof 40 for example this has the character of
 that therefore i attend in a manner consistent with all preceding experiences
 pertaining to that and moreover i will likely behave similarly in future
 instances wherein the character of that presents itself imaging texting and so
 forth are such behaviors in the moment of red be it flower car shoestring
 signage or discarded boxing material i attend i image or i might text the
 example clarifies that attention is a function of habit as peirce posits habit
 forms by means of multiple reiterated behaviour of the same kind under similar
 combinations of percepts perception and fancies imagination 41 he goes on to
 explain that repetition inclines a person to behave in a similar way under
 similar circumstances in the future what peirce posits ultimately is that
 habit operates according to the future conditional and therefore guarantees a
 certain predictability of recurrence any consistency in sharing that is any
 patterns observable in the streams of thumbnails texts or mobile updates a
 person produces is an expressing of the person as such here we might consider
 rate and frequency of imaging typical times and locations for imaging kinds of
 objects and people imaged quantity of images for any one kind of object or
 person typical quality of imaging amount of blurring suggestive of movement of
 different sorts and so on self-expression is legible in these patterns
<< page >>
 once
 they are made visible by clever software as series repetitions combinations
 chunkings and juxtapositions across streams of mobile imaging thumbnails 42
 consider again the color red as it so pervades my own imaging practice viewing
 habits cultivated by institutions such as museums as supported by the
 discipline of art history might encourage us to focus on red objects in a
 series of images to consider the quality of the overall composition and to
 speculate about the aesthetic skill and intentions of the person who composed
 them the recurrence of red in a person s streamings of images however allows
 us to ask an entirely different sort of question one more oriented to
 spontaneous response than artistic skill one might well wonder how red in its
 varying shapes and hues catalyzes affect in the person who images in what ways
 and at what moments it inspires or incites imaging if a person chooses to
 reflect on a particular framing of red in an image and whether or not it is
 pleasing to others the person may remain in ignorance of a deeper response to
 red as revealed in her or his image streams 43 attention to patterns in
 imaging practice how many times at what time and by what manner red appears
 allows for recognizing modes of expression constitutive of for lack of a
 better word identity and how said identity is articulated across various
 platforms expressivity is twofold in this context because in the moment of
 imaging or texting etc one is also activating computational processes on one
 hand expressivity refers to autobiographical practice broadly construed on the
 other algorithmic operations as coded by computer scientists 44 to distinguish
 between these is to acknowledge what espen j aarseth terms a functional
 difference between the discrete and intentionally organized narratives of self
 one might consciously articulate in prose speech or internal dialog and the
 data one proliferates daily at the level of impulse which provides an ongoing
 accounting of one s whereabouts and
<< page >>
 doings be these purchases tweets or gps
 coordinates 45 and almost always the data one proliferates is parsed
 algorithmically
<< comp pls insert qr03_05 about here >>
 thinking in terms of expressivity allows us to consider conventional
 assumptions we may have about the role of narrative in practices of self-
 expression narrative is retrospective at a distance from though not
 necessarily objective about events being recounted and it assumes an integral
 relation between sequence and consequence in recounting some incident from one
 s experience one explains describes and contextualizes a series of micro-
 events into a whole and significantly from a place or moment beyond the
 experience itself the formal habits or conventions of such autobiographical
 practice promise even if they do not deliver coherence and semantic clarity
 neither of which characterizes the kind of documentation of self one generates
 through typical practices of mobile imaging or texting or otherwise posting
 updates from a mobile device for that matter which frequently occur at the
 level of spontaneity and impulse or proto-self as i suggest in the preceding
 chapter this is not to say that social media abolish the narrative conventions
 of autobiography certainly any number of narrative accounts might be
 attributed to a particular string of images after the fact nonetheless the
 shear volume of images posted to various social-networking sites exceeds the
 conditions of possibility for narrative as typically imagined or better yet
 desired narrative coherence is significantly troubled by social networking s
 encouragement to link across various threads of interest engagement and
 interaction if narrative residue surfaces in streams of thumbnails it is in
 part because of people s disciplined relation to imaging we have been
 habituated to make our pictures illustrate for example a vacation trip to
 accompany the story we might tell about it nixon s the augustas demonstrates a
 basic point amplified and augmented by a particular platform s e g flickr
 circa 2009 articulating
<< page >>
 streams of augustas images may also render an
 expressivity that has little to do with the syntax of a journey after all one
 who may be drawn to imaging red is not necessarily confessing a love of red
 the person is not necessarily engaged in a critical self-disciplining work but
 this person s sharing of self via images of red she or he posts might very
 well participate in a regulatory process in which case sharing differs from
 confessing even as it bears a functional similarity more relevant than whether
 or not narrative serves to explain any series of images is the fact that
 images are distributed across the broader social-networking community while
 any participant might provide her or his images with a personal inflection by
 means of habits in imaging and tagging this expressive particularity is parsed
 in relation to a variety of external inputs and influences including other
 platform-specific members and subscribers visiting commenters software
 companies and their employees and so on importantly then expressivity and the
 aesthetics thereof only emerges as such within a semiotically dense highly
 organized social situation what constitutes the expressive as such is not
 necessarily a matter of an individual s concerted self- expression as might be
 the case for example with diaristic practice instead what constitutes the
 expressive is a historically contingent sociocultural construct involving many
 contributors and technologies to illustrate we might consider the difference
 between nixon s home movie and a tag cloud as a system for visualizing tag
 usage according to frequency tag clouds are folksonomy pools loosely
 controlled vocabulary clusters that are participant generated not
 institutionally in explicit sense produced and overseen tag clouds
 alphabetically order all of the keyword tags in use by any one or more
 participants they appear in strings of text that wrap around at the end of
 lines within a delineated field boldness of color or font scale indicates each
 tag s frequency within a given
<< page >>
 pool which may include data added by one
 participant or billions not only do tag clouds track tag usage but also they
 serve a navigational purpose one can browse a cache of assets such as a series
 of related thumbnail images simply by clicking on a desired tag however
 navigation proves curious at times since the semantic relationship between two
 assets e g images is frequently based upon a statistical relationship
 identified algorithmically in tagging patterns an image might acquire tags
 through a process other than personal choice and designation when an algorithm
 determines the set of instructions or recipe for defining a series of
 operations that associate variously labeled images as information architect
 gene smith explains two seemingly unrelated and in fact non-identically tagged
 assets might be statistically related as a consequence of other tags the
 assets have in common 46 for example any two thumbnail images posted to a
 particular social-networking site may not be tagged identically with the
 keyword augusta yet the two images might very well share a relationship based
 upon other tags identified as related because such relation is inferred by an
 algorithm parsing usage patterns of a population of users inversely two images
 tagged augusta may never inhabit the same screen space because their
 statistical relationship ensures their separation this occurs because
 algorithms function to look at tagging patterns 47 they are not interested in
 semantic relationships they interpret words not as symbols but rather as
 degrees of relationship with other terms no individual act of tagging can
 effectively equal a feat of categorization for the community of users since an
 algorithm oversees that process 48

 in contrast the organization of augustas in the augustas seems easily
 attributable to an idiosyncratic individual nixon edited shots together in a
 single string of celluloid to be threaded through a projector and screened at
 a later time technological affordances determine linear organization and

<< page >>
 temporal duration of the work 49 despite its requisite sequentiality however
 there is a haphazard or random character to the order of augustas neither
 chronology nor geography explains their organization nonetheless this seeming
 randomness is bracketed by the film s opening and concluding sequences which
 suggest a narrative thread that is never quite accessible to the audience the
 imperative that gentlemen will please refrain from smoking spitting or using
 profane language during the performance begins the film and a title shot that
 reads and so our trip ends concludes it 50 if the cinematic sequence defines
 nixon s film the logic of the template or the stream governs how images appear
 on social-networking sites frequently images posted to such sites are
 relatively confined to the schematic view of columns and perhaps rows upon a
 screen in reverse chronological order according to date and time of posting by
 a particular member of the community rather than the intentional editing
 together of shots such sites register updates in the time of their posting an
 actual database introduces properly algorithmic associations and a database
 rhythm altering the relations between the enframed image and its sequencing
 thereby opening onto a new expressive dimension through the surplus value of
 more or less elegant code so while there may be a linearity of sorts perhaps
 line or grid formation to images proliferating on social-networking sites they
 have a seriality that nixon s the augustas does not really a matter of
 chunking e g of similarly tagged assets counterpoint e g of variously posted
 content and chronology of posting this seriality can be understood in terms of
 rhythm and pacing according to more than the spatially oriented terms of an
 image s form content and placement while the naturalized visual structuration
 of the content management system might focus an eye on and suggest the
 prominence of a linear logic as established by columns and rows which is
 suggestive of unidirectionality belonging to left-to-right

 top-to-bottom
 scansion the expressive tempo of imaging and posting and subsequent tagging is
 what matters the pauses and repetitions and the nuances of a steady or
 staccato pulsing of imaging or its more sporadic occurrences are what count
 because these are always potentially indexes of the proto-self damasio it s
 not the image that matters so much as i suggest above but the act of imaging
 which occurs in the moment of the peircean interpretant or at the time of the
 proto-self in chapter 2 i describe the neurophysiological phenomenon of
 attention as it transpires in relation to a mobile device being in hand this
 attention in relation can now be considered more fully in its expressive
 dimension in the example of image postings appearing on various
 social-networking sites constituted with the aid of a database and software a
 device in hand materializes intensities of various kinds including degrees of
 attachment interest fancy surprise distaste and so forth to approach the
 thumbnail image as an image only that is as a two-dimensional representation
 cut off from the rich metadata it accumulates and entails would be to reduce
 the complexity of the articulated engagement of a person with a device and the
 person s milieu rather than emphasize the image as a discrete visual artifact
 social-networking platforms emphasize the tendencies or habits in imaging both
 for a person and across a larger community or population of users
 traditionally and according to a still current educational practice one would
 look for the art of a photograph in how the image is framed and composed what
 it depicts and whether it suitably heeds or defies conventions of
 representation i am suggesting a reorientation of concerns about expressivity
 away from the artifact and its subsequent interpretation toward the practice
 of expression organized through the mediation of mobile devices rhythm and
 pace communicate something about a particular experience or a tendency in the
 way of experiencing with a mobile
<< page >>
 imaging device in hand in other words the
 patterns so materialized might be understood as a semantics or grammar of
 experiencing an expression of semiosis certainly images as discrete objects
 within a string or collection provide content to be parsed and rendered
 legible but i propose that it is more relevant to think in terms of a dynamics
 of inflection as modulated through the immediacy or force of stimulation this
 is to suggest that the expressive character of a discrete thumbnail image is
 actually a matter of how attraction is cognitively constellated in relation to
 a stimulus or stimuli at the level of the proto-self in this instance imaging
 is cognition or semiosis it is interpretation to which the keyword tag appends
 a second -order interpretation foucault s genealogy of confession falls short
 of providing a suitable account for the kind of practice this is principally
 because of its emphasis on the self likewise his later turn to tekn and ask
 sis suggests and only in the abstract terms of philosophy a sense of what
 habit might be 51 peirce on the other hand offers an account that is grounded
 that the streaming of thumbnails and related artifacts is governed by an
 imperative to accumulate and disperse in streams as determined by the content
 management system indicates that autobiographical impulse supplants
 autobiographical intent as the motivating force propelling the act of
 self-documentation as intensities that is ebbings and flows of attraction and
 peaks and valleys of interest become the mode of expression driving
 self-record the conventions of narrative and the distanced contemplation of
 the canvas hold less sway what s more a potentially ceaseless accounting of
 oneself results in a proliferation of self-record that exceeds the graphy
 underpinning more traditional autobiographical practice that tends to be
 devoted to establishing relations among distinct episodes in a personal story
 framing a life via prose in offering evidence of a proto-tagging sensibility
 in formation

 the augustas is unwittingly prescient about what expressivity
 entails in the context of mobile technologies at the same time it reveals that
 the signs that mark our sites always already signal that the terrain upon
 which we tread is virtually ever shifting extending beyond nixon s film
 through the present the case of augusta provides a frame through which to
 reconsider how persons get mapped how social relations get instituted and how
 populations are thereby managed these pictures of augusta teach us that
 findability always has an expressive as well as an instrumental capacity and
 that the former may destabilize the latter without ever really dismantling it
 for a long time now we have desired to place ourselves and our peers on the
 map such feats of self-placement make calculable persons of us all we need a
 language to describe the expressive dimension of such quotidian feats one that
 does not engage the confessional evaluative apparatus of art criticism after
 all the issue is not really aesthetics in general but an expressive register
 that is neither always intentional nor necessarily confessional nor is
 expressivity necessarily attributable to any individual person who might be
 declared self-aware and purposeful this is because expressivity transpires at
 the level of the organism at the level of attention as triggered by impulse or
 cognition at the level of habit formation and therefore at the level of
 population 52

 developed in the preceding chapters these political discourses posit the
 individual as an autonomous economic and political agent in so doing they
 nonetheless confirm the effectiveness of biopower this is the lesson of michel
 foucault s theorization of security which posits that good governance involves
 the ongoing management of the circulations of various bodies be these goods
 persons currency or information the management of circulating bodies does not
 require them to be visible but it does require them to be findable this
 insight reorients consideration of contemporary media culture in 2006 wendy
 chun called attention to the control-freedom paradox 1 in her discussion of
 the internet and fiber optics she identified a tendency for people to assume
 that freedom

 amounts to invulnerability and that invulnerability eludes
 implication in processes of control in a complementary way i contend that we
 should be concerned less with privacy than with location less with democracy
 than with mobility less with the smartness of networked collectives than with
 their mappable interconnections it is also useful to consider the problem of
 administration in mobile media culture as having a longer history one that
 reaches back past the personal computer the movie screen and the panopticon to
 roman camps and roadways if the augustas reminds us that camera-carrying
 mobile insurance agents precede the mobile phone augustan rome teaches us that
 governance has long concerned itself with managing circulations of all sorts
 indeed from one point of view governance itself is a matter of infrastructures
 and techniques for keeping track of but also facilitating mobilities

 read against the grain apple s legendary 1984 commercial supports the point
 that governance requires mobilities even as it aims to regulate and in fact
 place them 2 introducing the macintosh personal computer the advertisement
 perpetuates the liberal fantasy of individual persons as political and
 economic agents of change by depicting media as a means of disciplining the
 masses while addressing consumers as members of a population invoking orwell s
 big brother trope as well as fritz lang s dystopian view of an industrial
 future in metropolis 1927 it begins by associating control of information with
 habitual obedience the commercial opens with an extreme long shot that
 discloses a vast gray industrial interior comprising an uncountable number of
 floors a luminescent tube stretches diagonally across the image the camera
 draws closer to this tube and we hear a low rumble punctuated
<< page >>
 by a recurring
 chime over what sounds like a pa system the tube is transparent through its
 curved surface we observe hundreds of human bodies marching centipede-like
 offscreen an authoritative masculine voice intones today we celebrate 3 a
 low-angle shot reveals uniformly dressed bodies trudging through the tube
 single file as the voice continues the first glorious anniversary of the
 information glorification directives the rhythm of marching of feet against
 grated metal flooring reverberates throughout the tubular corridor which is
 lined with crt screens that emit an unpleasant aqua-tinted glow a rapidly
 edited sequence follows revealing a blonde woman in red running shorts
 charging down a corridor with a hammer in hand heavily armed troops in pursuit
 of her and a line of gray-attired individuals marching toward and then seated
 rank and file in an auditorium the intercutting of these shots provides a
 narratively elliptical counterpoint to the authoritarian voice-over
 emphasizing words like ideology and unification of thoughts we see that voice
 has a source in a bespectacled talking head whose visage appears big brother
 like on a massive screen the size of the screen commands the attention of the
 stultified masses in contrast the woman gives the impression of being an
 olympian her motion and attire mark her difference 4 the commercial concludes
 with the shattering of the screen the blonde athlete having hurled her hammer
 into it in the wake of this destruction a refined masculine voice announces on
 january 24th apple computer will introduce macintosh this new voice continues
 and you ll see why 1984 won t be like 1984

 the image dissolves into a black title screen featuring apple s iconic
 rainbow-striped apple logo the macintosh itself is withheld from view instead
 the commercial solicits identification with the colorful deviant who resists
 mass discipline true the camera s viewpoint sometimes places us among the
 seated bodies staring in blank submission at the screen

 in this way it may
 encourage savvy viewers to equate that positioning with the screen encounter
 they are simultaneously experiencing that irony qualifies without obviating
 the principle fantasy on offer rejection of uniformity and passivity in favor

 post-1984 millions have invested in personal communications appliances made by
 apple and its competitors if this activity succeeds in thwarting the dystopian
 future envisioned in the advertisement that is because the advertisement
 conjured as apple s foil an image of control that was already obsolete lang s
 late weimar idea of machinelike social control and orwell s depression-era
 vision of information control are hyperobsessed with the masses versus
 individuals but liberalism really works by placing individuals within
 populations if they move toward macintosh consumers may adopt the athlete s
 ethos but they hardly embody her defiance consumerism accommodates and
 encourages differences in this context individual choice does not rebel
 against mass marketing but embraces it similarly that we have imagined
 ourselves as having individual opinions that count in the context of the whole
 is evidence of a mode of governance that does not oppose individuality and
 regulation those who mobilize politically by means of their mobile devices may
 challenge particular regimes while simultaneously reinforcing mechanisms of
 governance that work by making individuals findable and calculable

 seeing is much less important than locating for contemporary governance among
 recent media theorists richard grusin is rare in pointing this out 8 in
 premediation affect and mediality after 9/11 he explains that connectivity i e
 of our various devices supplants surveillance as previously understood not
 only does connectivity provide the capacity to connect the dots as grusin
 suggests but it also makes increasingly evident a fundamental and pervasive
 desire for and expectation of locatability habits of connecting and sharing
 which emerge out of technological connectivity coincide with an increased
 attention to and awareness of location we are and apparently want to be
 locatable at all times that our various devices default to gps connectivity
 and the applications that populate our devices invariably would like to use
 your current location underscores this now principle concern as does the fact
 that mobile phone users voluntarily announce where-ness for example when
 answering calls and texting friends the emphasis on findability makes apparent
 the importance that mobility has for contemporary individuals and those who
 would manage populations of them that nearly all of us are almost always
 locatable explicitly recognizes the increasing tendency for persons and things
 to be always on the go unlike the trope of surveillance tracking designates an
 ongoing triangulation of bodies information and security endemic to societies
 whose members are compelled to proliferate information via mobile technologies
 in this context the term foregrounds the fact that risk management relies on
 ceaselessly trailing movements and tracing shifts to trail and to trace refer
 to the continuous registering as data of proliferating micro- events that are
 not necessarily seen ocularly keeping track indexes as opposed to images
<< page >>
 or
 symbolizes various mobilities proliferating circulations the processing of
 such indices always potentially transpires in real time 9 while we might say
 that technology sees where an asset is when we do so we apply a visual
 metaphor to an essentially avisual process that registers that asset s
 location via electromagnetic waves independently of sight as such contemporary
 vernacular misleads us when it uses being seen to refer to the availability of
 one s data traces as opposed to for example the iconographic capture of one s
 body tropes such as sniffing phishing and mining better capture what it means
 to manage data it is well worth asking whether metaphors of visibility are
 appropriate to describe how power operates by the first decades of the
 twenty-first century if persons are not literally watched or seen then we need
 to reconceptualize governance and the specificities of its techniques in truth
 governance has for a long time depended on such avisual mechanisms it is
 necessary to point this out thanks to foucault s success in popularizing
 bentham s panopticon as a metaphor for power not to mention his related
 observation regarding the french infinitive voir to see and its etymological
 centrality to both savoir to know and pouvoir to be able i e power it can be
 easy to forget that foucault developed the panoptic principle in relation not
 only to bentham s prison but also to a discussion of public opinion which he
 identifies as an important political force dating to the french revolution and
 jean-jacques rousseau s ideal of a transparent society that is visible and
 legible in all its parts 10 in calling attention to the fact that liberal
 society idealizes a form of visibility foucault challenges the habit of
 understanding opinion formation as a process that occurs primarily through
 reading and writing he also calls attention to the habit of using visual
 metaphors to describe avisual processes here the idiomatic expression i see
 what you re saying is a case in point liberalism s
<< page >>
 account of self-governance
 heavily emphasizes the efficacy of speaking one s mind and also imagines
 citizens capable of being able to see know or be informed about the whole of
 society in order to govern themselves within it foucault notices this
 discourse of visibility within what is more typically thought of as a verbal
 process of public opinion formation whether it transpires in the coffeehouse
 town hall forum or public square announcing one s opinion in such venues
 functions as a form of visibility one might say that opinion is cellular
 individual views either gain or lose distinction in relation to public opinion
 from the verbal interaction of variously interested individuals a collective
 will is imagined to take shape and become a ruling force but like the norms of
 good conduct governing jeremy bentham s prisoners public opinion is a
 regulative abstraction produced and maintained within state institutions the
 development of public opinion after rousseau supports this point 11 management
 of opinion has become a major undertaking of government and private enterprise
 when surveys and polls quantify and objectify public opinion by means of
 statistical samples as they learned to do with increasing precision in the
 twentieth century individuals views are represented numerically without being
 seen or heard at all 12 opinion management employs all types of signs it works
 however not by making individuals feel that they are under observation but by
 making them feel that their opinions have been heard or taken into account
 this is why foucault is right to describe bentham as a complement to rousseau
 panopticism and public opinion are halves of a whole 13 the panopticon isn t
 the true power behind liberal self-governance merely part of the machinery of
 it foucault s work acknowledges the insufficiency of visual metaphors in his
 turn in the late 1970s to problems of circulations and multiplicities whereas
 his discipline and punish inspired
<< page >>
 numerous critics to think about modern
 culture as surveillant the lectures on governmentality characterize a
 reconfiguration of power in which discipline liberty and security function as
 complementary logics that replace sovereignty 14 foucault develops an account
 of security as an exercise in risk management that sources and assesses
 information regarding the routines patterns and sequences of transaction and
 engagement among persons and products although security does not begin to
 replace sovereignty in europe until sometime in the eighteenth century the
 physiocrats of the seventeenth century nonetheless have important antecedents
 in ancient roman administration starting in the eighteenth century foucault
 sees the emergence of an order that conceives movement of persons goods
 contagions and so forth as inevitable security allow s circulations to take
 place 15 the shift to securitization is a response to the effective
 impossibility of exercising sovereign control over a multiplicity of
 concurrent movements or what i refer to as mobilities those responsible for
 governing mobilities understand that movements that might appear totally
 unrelated to one another might nonetheless have a common effect on the welfare
 of the realm in eighteenth-century europe this involved the emergence of a
 notion of mutual commerce i e across western europe and the inception of a
 globalized or open market insofar as the world becomes a market for and in
 relation to europe 16 this kind of thinking has since become so familiar that
 even the dullest conspiracy thriller can conjure catastrophic outcomes out of
 seemingly unrelated electronic transfers of funds mobile phone conversations
 and long shots of numbers of commuters for a long time now it has not been
 feasible to control such movements by means of prohibition restriction or
 sustained confinement thus foucault explains security hinges on knowing where
 things are and ensuring that they are always in movement constantly moving
 around continually
<< page >>
 going from one point to another 17 it proceeds according to
 risk management governance qua security reconceptualized the town itself
 informed by the spatial arrangement of the roman camp as a space of
 circulation 18 like a heart eighteenth-century planners began to explain the
 town s infrastructure regulates hygiene prosperity in trade and public safety
 by paying attention to how goods people water germs and the like moved in and
 out of towns and through them planners and administrators found a means to
 address overcrowding make room for new economic and administrative functions
 deal with relationships out of town and allow for growth organizers of
 circulations learned to distinguish between good and bad arrangements in order
 to maximize the former while diminishing the effects of the latter crucially
 they developed a capacity to think in terms of and thereby manage an
 indefinite series of mobile elements 19 this requires a flexible framework
 that evolves and adapts according to what might happen 20 such a framework
 does not rely on what is plainly visible or readily ascertainable and while it
 measures and quantifies it does not do so to fix that is to still and isolate
 but to forecast future trends growth of population and increased commerce
 between town and surroundings required opening up enclosures and managing
 flows of people goods and money but also and more abstractly knowledge and
 power the town became something other than a concretely bounded site defined
 by for example a gate barred and locked nightly foucault begins to use the
 term milieu to characterize the new permeability attributed to the town it
 suggests greater plasticity and adaptability comprising both natural and
 artificial givens the milieu is that in which circulation is carried out 21
 more like a web of circumstances than a site-specific environment or a
 demarcated territory or property a milieu comprises
<< page >>
 natural and built physical
 sites as well as persons commodities vehicles germs and information all in
 motion multiple and simultaneous mobilities perforated by constant comings and
 goings the border s import could scarcely be grasped according to the previous
 logic of containment and permission a more permeable set of boundaries posed
 new and specific economic and political challenges and made apparent that a
 system of rigid constraints would not provide a viable means of effecting
 control administrators needed a new repertoire of techniques in order to
 manage the various circulations constitutive of that milieu techniques of
 security try to grasp these mobilities at the level of their nature that is at
 the level of their effective reality 22 here reality refers to the locus where
 things are taking place whether or not they are desirable 23 implementing and
 subsequently sustaining effective governance requires government to respond to
 the fluctuations accumulations dispersals reallocations and various other
 mobilities experienced by and in the milieu whether these be vehicular or
 biological naturally occurring or manufactured 24 governance according to the
 logic of security strives to take advantage of the various phenomena that
 function within and support the milieu it seeks to make compliance as easy as
 possible to work prophylactically and to apply corrective measures only when
 necessary there is no exercise of a will over others in the most homogeneous
 continuous and exhaustive way possible 25 neither is there exhaustive
 surveillance of individuals 26 rather there is the pervasive and ceaseless
 management of the states and conditions that is the reality of what comprises
 the milieu or as foucault clarifies security assesses degrees of risk it seeks
 to address a threat s ill but not necessarily abnormal effects it may be
 tempting to oppose security to discipline which foucault opposes to
 sovereignty in discipline and punish like the
<< page >>
 sovereign s power discipline
 acts on individuals and territories whereas security administers mobilities
 and as such is interested neither in self-regulation nor in the prohibition
 and containment of movement but this is misleading concerned with populations
 security tracks multiple and distributed movements in this sense it does not
 rely on the self-discipline of individuals nor does it seek docility but the
 logic of security is not wholly distinct from that of discipline like
 discipline security deals with norms and seeks to make conduct manageable by
 making it knowable and predictable whereas discipline thinks the norm to be an
 optimal model according to which the abnormal or deviant gets defined security
 multiplies distributions of normality across a population e g according to age
 neighborhood and occupation 27 it works with normative ranges defining
 conditions in need of more or less managerial intervention this means that
 security always involves a great deal of data processing sourcing and
 assessing information regarding various routines patterns and sequences of
 transaction and engagement the census polling as occurs in politics as well as
 consumer reviews and other surveys internet browsing histories log-in
 registers for networked servers and phone and credit card usage summaries are
 all examples of the ways in which security samples data about and thereby
 monitors that is tracks the population

 in the introductory pages of security territory population foucault mentions
 the roman camp as a precursor to the early modern town the famous form of the
 roman camp he notes reemerged as an organizational strategy in protestant
 countries in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries
<< page >>
 when it
 provided a model for regulating circulations by means of organizing space 28
 this prototype invites a more complex analysis of the problem of circulation
 than foucault finds himself able to develop specifically it challenges us to
 see the relationship between administration and infrastructure networks as
 more resilient and extensive than might appear in accounts of modernity that
 emphasize the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries visual renderings of the
 roman camp are abundant online and in print and they typically represent the
 camp as a square or rectangular perimeter within which all structures also
 square or rectangular are arranged in grid-like fashion adhering to a logic of
 subdivision the roman camp presents a semirigid outline ever-smaller quadrants
 of varying dimensions fill the fixed boundaries although they do not
 necessarily abide a prerequisite of symmetry diagrams of the roman camp make
 readily apparent the modular architecture that inspires foucault s comparison
 between the camp and the town they also reveal a protodisciplinary
 configuration an abstract and measured space well suited for legibility and
 ease of navigation according to charted pathways such that it would be easy to
 recognize something or someone as out of place it is as foucault states an
 instance of structuring a space according to gridded but flexible containment
 29 foucault emphasizes the completely artificial that is re constructed
 character of space which he contends does not apply to a notion of territory
 whereas a territory is a bounded area of land at the center of which is the
 seat of power the town is structured so as to organize the people who inhabit
 it thus they might be governed without being dominated significantly he notes
 the move to structure the space of the town along the lines of the roman camp
 recognizes the problem of circulation increase in trade introduces more
 circulation and a greater need for streets and the possibility of cutting
 across them 30 as a model it acknowledges the need to provide
<< page >>
 a hierarchical
 and functional distribution of elements 31 which is both measured and
 measurable even if it is not fixed or stationary in other words it is a
 configuration that anticipates movements of various sorts the better to direct
 them accounts of the roman camp based on archeological evidence provide an
 even better perspective on how this spatial arrangement regulates movement as
 discussed in lawrence keppie s the making of the roman army from republic to
 empire the histories of polybius ca 160 bc describe a temporary and portable
 but regularly laid-out military camp 32 it was itself mobile at the same time
 as it patterned movements within its boundaries used initially during the
 roman republic ca 508 27 bc such camps were town-like before foucault s towns
 were camp-like they had a main street for the movement of animals persons and
 vehicles and an open market for the circulation of goods and currency keppie
 indicates a strong likelihood that military engineers adopted the layout from
 contemporary town-planners 33 a fact that suggests an interesting instance of
 complementarity between military strategy and social order this point finds
 confirmation in the fact that a consistent and precise plan defined camp
 installation hierarchically making transparent each man s station 34 the tent
 belonging to the commanding magistrate occupied a central position 35 on
 either side of this tent stood the tent of the junior magistrate the one
 responsible for handling financial affairs and the forum i e market tents
 housing the legions were erected in front of this configuration keppie goes on
 to explain that camp design underwent refinement during the years of empire 27
 bc ad 14 becoming more stationary under gaius octavius who assumed the name
 gaius julius caesar octavianus octavian upon the death of julius caesar and
 who later came to be known as caesar augustus for whom the month of august is
 named in the later years of empire the more stationary summer and winter camps
 developed
<< page >>
 into forts and fortresses some camps eventually evolved into still
 extant towns 36 under augustus the roman empire s social order developed along
 with its spatial organization in the urban image of augustan rome diana favro
 describes augustus as committed to the care of the city beginning with rome s
 urban infrastructure augustan rome developed waterworks transportation systems
 public works and what we would now call emergency response systems e g
 brigades of men charged with fighting fires and keeping order at night 37 this
 mode of urban management inspired a new ratio-aesthetics that demonstrated an
 increasing concern for pragmatism functionality and order in the shaping of
 the cityscape engineering management skills and aesthetics received equal
 emphasis under augustan rule the aim was to construct roads aqueducts and
 sewers to form pragmatic networks of a large metropolis 38 this urban
 infrastructural development existed in tandem with a clear articulation of
 landmarks notes paths districts and edges 39 to effect a new sociospatial
 legibility that privileged vertical lines and repetition 40 the tight visual
 configuration of public building projects of the time adhered to principles of
 functionality significantly augustus favored multipurpose building forms that
 were adaptable for the changing needs of the imperial bureaucracy 41 this then
 was a pioneering instance of a flexible networked infrastructure of the sort
 that we now take for granted as desirable the rise of what would become a
 permanent municipal bureaucracy dates to 17 bc 42 augustus instituted various
 curatorial boards which were organized hierarchically tasked with clearly
 defined responsibilities these boards were provided with state funding and
 permanent trained staff according to favro curators heads of board held their
 posts for long periods allowing them to develop expertise in their areas of
 responsibility document their activities and develop pride in their
 achievements 43 moreover
<< page >>
 the bureaucratic structure according to which
 administration evolved under augustus meant that the compilation of
 comprehensive records for urban maintenance also stimulated pride in the
 office not just the individual 44 warehouses were constructed for holding
 goods before distribution and a census was conducted the result of which was
 the reapportionment of rome into fourteen regions instead of its previous
 configuration as the seven hills ultimately favro explains the xiv regions
 represented a comprehensive system and rome acquired the appearance of a
 well-ordered society with everyone having a place and a responsibility such
 that augustus stabilized his broad power base 45 power here is an imperial
 power belonging to a sovereign augustus we have not yet arrived at the
 invisible hand of the market or public opinion for example as a regnant force
 still the techniques for administering by managing flows look uncannily
 similar to those that would later be imagined by the french town planners
 foucault talks about the process of rationalization that began to define rome
 s legal and administrative framework finds a corollary in the roman
 intellectual endeavor of the time as the contributors to the explicitly
 foucauldian ordering knowledge in the roman empire explain in their
 introduction editors jason konig and tim whitmarsh assert the fact of empire
 crucially changed the way in which knowledge was used abused presented and
 represented 46 in particular they note the move towards specialised knowledge
 47 they describe intellectual work of the roman empire as predominately
 functional as opposed to aesthetic in nature underpinning konig s and
 whitmarsh s argument and central to the other essays comprising the collection
 is foucault s notion of archive they remind us that foucault conceives the
 archive as a habit of thought an intellectual genre an inter-related set of
 culturally operative but also embattled propositions as to the necessary

<< page >>
 properties and social role of language 48 furthermore they explain that
 archival thinking is propelled by a desire to itemise and order knowledge 49
 here the example of roman texts of miscellany textual compilations of diverse
 objects of knowledge proves instructive the editors describe such texts as
 being not simply random collections or enumerations of discrete and seemingly
 unconnected phenomena rather such compilations serve as map s of society
<< dcq >>
 and thus are archive s in action wherein one can observe the hierarchies
 equivalences regularities and equivocations structuring the world as a locus
 for the production of knowledge 50 their principle example is roman doxography
 which gathers and records philosophical opinions of various sorts 51 this
 period of empire also gave rise to two transformative technologies related to
 the encyclopedia the codex i e bound book and the table of contents the former
 particularly interests konig and whitmarsh proceeding according to what the
 editors anachronistically albeit suggestively call hypertextuality the codex
 afforded new practices of cross-referencing and non-linear reading because it
 could index contents by page number 52 what these developments suggest the
 editors argue is that in the roman empire
<< soq >>
 knowledge is to be conceived of as an aggregate of discrete particles that are
 to be subjected to a process of analytical ordering 53 already in the first
 centuries of the roman empire under augustus knowledge was becoming a function
 of ongoing processes of sorting sampling and classification because it was a
 function of a process it could not be regarded as particularly stable or
 permanent not surprisingly intellectual endeavor in ancient rome pre- and
 early empire was initially the domain of the elite or more specifically
 individual families of wealth and therefore political influence however with
 the civil war augustus revised who commanded and mobilized knowledge no longer
 matter-of-factly the
<< page >>
 province of elite families knowledge came under the
 jurisdiction that is care of designated experts a historical move toward a
 bureaucratic logic that complemented the development of urban infrastructure
 as konig and whitmarsh explain political authority was based on delegation of
 knowledge rather than possession of it 54 power as defined by the sovereign
 ruler who delegated intellectual responsibilities managed knowledge production
 the organization of empire mapped onto the ordering and orders of knowledge
 authorship no longer entailed the expectation of inspiration but rather could
 be thought of as a self-conscious utility e g the stoic practice of the
 regular nightly accounting of one s actions an author edits and organizes
 pre-existing units of knowledge 55 arrangement becomes an intellectual project
 in its own right 56 and commentary translations epitomisation and summary all
 become considered viable modalities for arranging and rearranging knowledge
 the emergence of various but interrelated approaches to organizing an empire
 of knowledge coincided with the development of a network infrastructure
 necessary for imperial rule ordering knowledge and ordering empire were
 mutually reinforcing activities dedicated to accumulation and expansion
 respectively 57

 i want to underscore the analogies among augustan rome s military camps
 adaptable architectures and reference-based knowledge production for they
 indicate a commitment to maintaining and ensuring fluidly functioning
 mechanisms of social existence including the movements of bodies goods and
 ideas this is why the roman camp provides foucault with such a good model for
 the early modern security state if in turn we understand the early modern
 security state as conditioned by the kind of roman camp that keppie helps us
 to envision we can understand eighteenth-century enlightenment and panopticism

 as genealogical
 forebears within a long-developing governmental logic that since augustan rome
 has recognized the importance of flexible adaptive and mobile techniques of
 management to a degree we have yet fully to appreciate contemporary digital
 networks inherit this legacy the mobile many recalling howard rheingold are
 administrative entities in ways that could not have been imagined in augustan
 rome yet the mechanisms by means of which such entities are managed form a
 complete infrastructure cities maps techniques for organizing knowledge and so
 forth that has been developing for millennia that we carry mobile devices in
 hand intensifies the effects of governance we inhabit the logistics of
 tracking and the avisual logic of findability which coordinates investments in
 locatability and navigability always on the move and always connected we are
 simultaneously bodies in motion and sites of relay that is points of mobility
 and conduits through which pass various mobilities monitoring registers or

 its operations go undetected its effects imperceptible diaphanous weightless
 it spreads by means of the very mobilities it monitors and in the process
 acquires the quality of automaticity that epitomizes normality and we adapt

 encouraged millions of television viewers not to smash the screens at which

 different in its aims and methods howard rheingold s widely read and cited
 2002 smart mobs presents a similar contrast between utopian and dystopian
 futures and points to the same fundamental aporia that results whenever
 individual expression and public opinion float free from self-discipline and
 population management 58 as stated in chapter 1 rheingold predicted that
 mobile technologies would facilitate coordination and cooperation among people
 worldwide he based his claim on his observation that in japan and finland
 young people were beginning to walk around with an always-on connection to the
 internet 59 he also foresaw that an increase in cooperation would be shadowed
 by threats against personal liberties especially privacy thus he represented
 in 2002 a moment of impending change defined by a sustained tension between
 doom and optimism nonetheless despite often prescient assessments of a
 technological future in which monitoring would be omnipresent it is clear that
 rheingold s smart mobs
<< dcq >>
 who would accomplish the next social revolution
<< dcq >>
 expresses a romantic hope that youthful citizen-individuals will join
 altruistically in collective action to create a a higher level of democracy 60
 this claim belies how biopolitical governance operates in and through
 individual practices and across populations parsing rheingold s phrase smart
 mobs allows us to understand how the mobile many collaborate in their own
 management regardless of whether they are overthrowing states or arranging
 dates the term mob in isolation still bears the negative connotations of an
 uncontainable rabble and some commentators found it unclear what exactly
 rheingold meant by qualifying it
<< page >>
 with the addition of the technology-oriented
 adjective smart as in smartphone referring to the networked activities of
 large and often geographically dispersed groups of people smart cannot denote
 individual intellect or cognitive potential rather as the new york times
 reported in december 2002 the smart in smart mob designates the intelligent
 emergent behavior of hive-style animals 61 that groups of people are described
 as exhibiting hive-like behavior as a consequence of their engagements with
 mobile technologies in particular mobile phones is interesting to consider for
 numerous reasons most significantly such intelligence would seem to be
 incompatible with a democratic social contract of rational self-interested
 individuals conceived according to the rousseauian or lockeian ideal for
 national communities of course it is not unusual to explain sociocultural
 phenomena metaphorically human temperament motivation and the like are
 frequently explained in terms of animal and insect traits but to the extent
 that emergent behavior is behavior that just emerges that is without intention
 the analogy hints at a mode of agency that might be at odds with democracy as
 we have learned to think and practice it this distinction has been lost in
 most discussions the smart mob has generally been framed as exemplary of
 democratic activity in the early twenty-first century individual citizens
 taking action indeed willfully deciding to take action collectively by means
 of their mobile devices rheingold s claim for this new mob smartness and the
 success of his formulation make more sense in light of a more complete history
 of the word mobs etymologically mob is a derivation of mobile which itself is
 a truncated form of mobile vulgus and functions as the root of mobility
<< dcq >>
 a noun that historically signified in contrast to nobility the term thus bears
 the traces of a contest over political power and over not only who should have
 it but also how it should be conceived the oxford english dictionary
<< page >>
 online
 identifies a shift in the meaning of mob around the middle of the eighteenth
 century 62 what in the late seventeenth century meant a disorderly or riotous
 crowd a rabble came to signify a large crowd or group of people esp a group of
 people sharing distinctive characteristics or a common identity or occupation
 these two definitions are quite distinct whereas the first figures the crowd
 according to its lack of containment that is its unruliness and amorphousness
 the second succeeds in finding order in the crowd by means of qualifying it as
 a group of readily classifiable people who might for example motivate
 historical change the first definition emphasizes the otherness of the crowd
 the second finds commonalities across a range of differences we shift from a
 model of exclusion to one that seeks to account for discontinuities within a
 delimited field of possibilities this semantic shift points to a fundamental
 revision in the logic according to which bodies are managed whereas once the
 goal was to exclude an unsavory mass the new logic seeks to apprehend what
 unites the different constituents of the crowd to understand them as numbers
 of individuals who might come to be associated in some other manner this
 latter mode of thinking about groups of people as a problem to be studied
 assumed prominence in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries we
 might think here of gustave le bon s agglomeration of men arthur schopenhauer
 s porcupines and siegfried kracauer s mass ornament wherein the transition
 from mob as unformed mass to population as social problem becomes definitive
 63 a comparable change in thinking of people foucault tells us occurred in
 europe as administrators of various sorts learned to treat mobile populations
 as both demographic units and citizen-individuals entitled to liberties under
 the law 64 the resulting system of governance according to foucault is frugal
 65 its techniques proceed according to a logic of least state that is
 laissez-nous
<< page >>
 faire law and freedom become complementary 66 foucault identifies
 these mutually constitutive principles as underpinning modern liberal
 governance at the root of which is only an interest in interests 67 interest
 here is not the material interest of sovereignty which invests in things in
 themselves e g land for itself rather what constitutes interest for modern
 liberal governance is more abstract and less stable or certain insofar as it
 deals in processes actions resources and so forth this new governmental reason
 is interested in the collective body of individuals it cares less about
 obedience than about the health and productivity of a growing mobile
 population the revolutionary mob and the population laissez-faire governance
 would manage are one in the same in contrast to a logic that opposes
 individual liberty and sovereign control the biopolitical project of risk
 management is ensured in part by the perpetuation of once revolutionary ideals
 that established an equivalence between the ability to express personal
 opinion and freedom of choice biopower has long counted on the public to
 mistake an investment in social legibility for political agency that there is
 a continuity of administrative endeavor does not mean that nothing has changed
 in fact our present might very well be as different from early modern france
 as early modern france was from imperial rome nonetheless it is crucial to
 acknowledge that those of us who recognize ourselves as concerned engaged and
 informed private citizens are at the same time behaving in a highly
 disciplinary fashion effective political action can and does occur by means of
 mobile devices as rheingold rightly points out in his now canonical example of
 the 2001 ousting of philippine president joseph estrada more recently mobile
 devices abetted the arab spring wherein a wave of civilian uprisings erupted
 across the arab world successfully forcing rulers from power 68 if we imagine
 however that the mobile many texted their way to political intervention
 through
<< page >>
 feats of individual will and deliberation as neoliberal rhetoric tends
 to do we will mistake the reality of contemporary rule that the rheingoldian
 interpretation overlooks the management of the mob becomes clear once we shift
 our attention from the problem of what the mobile many are texting to the
 problem of their devices being on and connected the responses of repressive
 governments to the arab spring s social-networking practices prove interesting
 to consider beyond the use of police and military force to suppress
 demonstrations on site the mubarak regime in egypt for example shut down the
 internet and blocked cellular service however as thomas sander executive
 director of harvard s saguaro seminar explains in a january 2011 blogpost
 titled twitter facebook and youtube s role in arab spring middle east
 uprisings such an unsubtle crackdown had adverse effects 69 not only did it
 serve to radicalize many rural egyptians who might not otherwise have been
 mobilized but also it imposed great economic costs the denial of access to
 social media may then have been more helpful to the revolution than was usage
 of it learning from this experience governments seem to appreciate that media
 can be more usefully controlled if they are not shut down in the case of
 second-generation revolutions sanders continues the state is becoming more
 sophisticated instead of full-frontal assaults on internet and cellular access
 and instead of targeting ring leaders states are spreading misinformation and
 slowing the speed of network access in other words management of populations
 even those engaged in protest involves managing signals circulating signs and
 the interpretation thereof despite its replication of liberalism s blind spot
 rheingold s forecast nonetheless seems prescient it would be difficult to
 dispute that people have become increasingly motivated to abide by the rules
 of online cooperation coordination and sharing that belong to what henry
 jenkins in 1992 called participatory
<< page >>
 culture 70 examples abound such as text
 messaging mobile imaging and posting announcements via mobile device which
 have become staple means of engagement for citizen journalists and flash mobs
 such practices do not deny the fact of national or territorial boundaries yet
 it is the case that geography and terrestrial distance matter less because
 networked devices are ready at hand a variety of content is always facilely
 and multiply distributable across numbers of users regardless of where in the
 world they connect moreover that persons worldwide post frequent status
 updates to their communities of friends and followers underscores an important
 shift in how we think about borders and how they demarcate here from there it
 seems like frequent updates can be shared ito from anywhere on location in
 real time we are connected and on grid this condition is integral to the
 smartness that rheingold attributes to the mobile many
<< comp pls insert qr04_04 about here >>
 to conclude i want to recall clive thompson s 2002 suggestion that we consider
 the novelty of hive smarts offering an image of social group formation that is
 controlled by no single person yet which moves as if it has a mind of its own
 the hive metaphor connotes an automatism absent self-awareness and willfulness
 71 the related metaphors of swarming and pack behavior function similarly
 there is certainly an optimism to the images such metaphors conjure notions of
 efficiency natural design and order resilience generativity and so forth at
 the same time these metaphors imply that those persons constitutive of the
 group qua smart mob are not free-thinking individuals in the cartesian or
 enlightenment sense so much as organisms or biological entities akin to bees
 or ants 72 human behavior is obviously more complex not least because we study
 ourselves relentlessly nonetheless the hive mind metaphor helps us recognize
 ourselves as creatures of habit wherein habit is necessarily social and
 thought
<< page >>
 in the mobile present our habits make us findable and manageable as
 populations avisual in nature and intensive but lightweight in its techniques
 this management regime is not easily overthrown it does not look like a big
 brother one may smash or a despot one may depose malleability is its virtue
 and also its vulnerability to these ends i propose we begin think toward habit

 an aesthetics of existence or habit-ing differently
<< txt >>

<< page >>
 in the previous chapters of this book i describe how various mobilities come
 to comprise what michel foucault calls the milieu i show how industrial design
 in its crafting of mobile handheld devices creates and normalizes a type of
 relation between hands and technologies that encourages a spontaneous rather
 than a deliberate or reflective relation to imaging texting and sharing
 content of all sorts chapter 2 i explain that semiotically the content
 rendered by these devices precisely because it sets in play a full range of
 interpretive relations offers itself to the kinds of recombination and leaving
 of individual traces we associate with self-expression while encouraging
 expressions of a nonconfessional sort chapter 3 and i argue that such
 practices or habits of expressivity insofar as they have become routine extend
 techniques of tracking more clearly and powerfully than they do techniques of
 surveillance chapter 4 this book s digital supplement augusta app chapter 1
 provides readers with a laboratory whereby they might engage explicitly the
 kinds of practices i have discussed and thereby test the limits of my argument
 in the pages remaining i would like to add one final dimension to the project
 of habit change that i have been advocating throughout
<< page >>
 foucault s conception
 of a politics of ourselves resonates with the project of habit change and
 suggestions that it must have an aesthetic dimension foucault describes an
 aesthetics of existence as a means by which the disciplinary subject an
 individual subject to normalizing self-regulation might be instantiated as an
 ethical subject someone whose practices of living demonstrate an awareness of
 self that simultaneously facilitates an attunement to the community of which
 she or he is a part this idea of aesthetics then cannot be understood as a
 quality distinguishing a specialized art practice but rather refers to a
 manner of conducting daily life to be relevant to twenty-first-century life
 this project needs to acknowledge the ubiquity of mobile devices pervasive
 connectivity and constant locatability 1 an aesthetics of existence invites us
 to reimagine the routine practices that for example litter social-networking
 feeds with self-divulging updates as i have explained we should understand
 these reports as involved in efforts to manage us as populations as well as
 entailing expressive aspects beyond those intended because they involve habits
 of which we are nonconscious physiological and semiological habit change
 manifests as a sort of intellectual sympathy 2 or a kind of mediated immediacy
 3 wherein intellection produces a quality of feeling that speaks both to
 bergsonian becoming what he also calls intuition 4 and antonio damasio s
 feeling of knowing that belongs to core consciousness likewise it is consonant
 with foucault s aesthetics of existence and suggests a reframing of the
 problem of art in relation to mobile media
<< comp pls insert qr05_01 about here >>
 in a 1983 interview entitled on the genealogy of ethics an overview of work in
 progress foucault asks couldn t everyone s life become a work of art 5 the
 question may seem unexpected given its seeming divergence from his previous
 scholarship on institutions power and architectures of truth 6 but it signals
 an increasing interest in ethos or practice
<< page >>
 of living which as foucault
 interprets the term always pursues a particular kind of knowledge tekhn or art
 not in the sense of high art but in the sense of practical arts or practice 7
 ethical living was the subject of a two-part lecture series three years
 earlier in which foucault considered a politics of ourselves wherein a person
 s style of living cultivates a creative relation not only to self but also to
 a population 8 as foucault envisions it a politics of ourselves seeks to
 stimulate within a community of persons a sensitivity to shared habits as
 opposed to the shared deliberations emphasized by the liberal democratic
 notion of citizen-individuals he imagines a very strong structure of existence
 without any relation with the juridical per se with an authoritarian system
 with a disciplinary system 9 ultimately he suggests how such habits morph in
 relation to a likewise ever-evolving milieu and according to the development
 of communal life as a future-oriented project rather than as a benthamite
 calculation habit change serves as an alternative to neo liberalism s framing
 of change as a problem of individual and collective choice or will instead of
 conceiving decision making according to that familiar juridico-legal model it
 finds responsiveness at the level of the organism as part of processes of
 cognition that involves our nonconscious proto-selves while responsiveness is
 always informed by processes of normation entailed by communal sign usage and
 a long history of biopolitical regulation it is socially binding our ways of
 knowing which materialize our ways of being are shared collectively through
 semiosis foucault s practice of artful living and charles sanders peirce s
 intellectual sympathy are among a variety of theoretical calls for enacting a
 more ethical existence others would certainly include gilles deleuze s pure
 immanence felix guattari s three ecologies and jacques derrida s hospitality
<< dcq >>
 all of which reject an end-directed political metanarrative in favor of
 ethical practice understood
<< page >>
 as an open-ended orientation toward others with
 whom one has social relation 10 in this vein contemporary theorists such as
 brian massumi elizabeth grosz and mark b n hansen have proposed models that
 privilege aesthetic experiences as means to live ethically massumi s recent
 writing about crafted facts of experience considers how aesthetic events might
 themselves speculate on life in order to resonate elsewhere to unpredictable
 affect and effect in the persons who experience them 11 grosz s plane of
 composition as the field of artistic production continues politics by other
 means such that new futures might be inhabited 12 similarly hansen s
 consideration of a haptic aesthetics that disorients one s relation to space
 asks us to call into question our tendency to abide visual spatial regimes 13
 aesthetic practice is not however the only route to this destination as karen
 barad demonstrates in turning to the quantum mechanics of neils bohr to
 conceptualize agential realism as an ongoing performative intra-action among
 material bodies which are not discrete entities but phenomena in relation 14
 despite their differences these lines of thought converge in insisting that
 change worth pursuing will require not new ideals but new types of lived
 relations with a changing milieu among those ethicists who draw directly on
 foucault to imagine a more attuned grosz practice of living roberto esposito
 has advocated a biopolitics that affirms life his affirmative biopolitics
 proposes that biopolitical immunitas which operates according to a logic of
 social hygiene and prophylaxis can be turned into its inverse communitas or
 collective life 15 esposito s model rightly affirms that advocacy of life in
 our present cannot reject but must seek to modify the regulatory process
 through which our institutions care for populations it is a matter not of
 rejecting normalizing habit but of modifying it to identify moments that
 exemplify this kind of change however ethicists working in this vein typically
 turn to disasters

 or other punctual events rather than less momentous everyday
 happenings for instance john protevi cites the delayed rescue efforts of post
 hurricane katrina in 2005 and the 1999 massacre at columbine high school in
 elaborating political affect encouraging us to recognize that we make our
 worlds in making sense of situations 16 he stresses that affective cognition
 insofar as it shapes how we engage the world is crucial to imagining how we
 constitute a body politic moreover it provides a means for thinking toward
 empathic solidarity 17 i am in favor of empathic solidarity but protevi s
 emphasis on traumatic events points to a limitation of his theorization of it
 specifically the emphasis on big institutions and national narratives of
 crisis neglects the everyday transactions that foucault and peirce agree must
 be at the center of any project to inspire more ethical ways of living in her
 discussion of various tactical media projects rita raley provides a way to
 imagine more concrete and specifically mobile conditions for intervention in
 the status quo orchestrated to effect a shared sensibility the tactical media
 projects that she investigates engage in and promote cultural critique by
 means of a micropolitics that mobilize the network to raise awareness 18
 everyday governance becomes the object of the disruption intervention and
 education working in and against dominant semiotic regimes defining the global
 present the media artists and collectives she discusses strive to trouble or
 disrupt routine processes of global capitalism border control and political
 campaigns they aim to make visible intervene in and educate by co-optation of
 the very systems they challenge

 of their
 communications the installation drew attention to the pervasive means by which
 populations are tracked in real time via interpersonal communications between
 1 november 2003 and 24 november 2003 text messages encoded as flashes of light
 pulsed through the night skies over the yamaguchi center for arts and media
 ycam in japan each sent message hung suspended above the center as it bounced
 from one search light to another in the form of a patterned light sequence no
 message ceased its circulation until it was caught by its designated recipient
 20 ultimately the installation provided a striking example of how the mobile
 many rheingold might visually redefine a public landscape john craig freeman
 and mark skwarek s border memorial frontera de los muertos 2012 offers another
 example one that pursues a more overtly political intervention an augmented
 reality ar application for mobile smartphones it uses geocoordinates to locate
 and give representation to the thousands of migrant workers who have died
 along the u s -mexico border in attempting to find work since the application
 is on-site and live in southern arizona individuals with the application
 downloaded and launched can raise their mobile devices to face the desert
 landscape one is able to visualize the scope of the loss of life in real time
 through the camera view as one scans the desert 21 at each location where a
 death has been documented a three-dimensional skeleton effigy appears
 on-screen as an overlay in october 2010 the museum of modern art in new york
 city hosted a version of border memorial whose skeleton effigies appear in a
 virtual desert setting overlaying a real-time image of the museum s courtyard
 by bringing to visibility the lives that have fallen for the sake of securing
 our borders border memorial contests u s policies that continue to overlook
 the human costs involved in contemporary labor and security arrangements 22

 discrete artworks even
 as they leverage a politics that would transgress a more conventionally
 accepted notion of artwork this may be a limitation the artwork and perhaps
 especially the status of a political artwork delimits in advance a social
 conceptual and often physical space while they might pursue other pedigrees
 new forms of media artwork nevertheless bear a filiation to fine art painting
 sculpture digital art and performance art and the histories of disciplined
 appreciation and engagement they entail 23 often artworks happen or are
 situated in museums or other sites specifically dedicated to the practice of
 engaging them such aesthetic objects often bear a burden of instantiating
 separatism and enabling elitism or at least they invoke a kind of privilege

 augusta app does not aspire to be identified as artwork nor does it avow a
 specific politics not installation art activist intervention or locative
 artwork it is more aptly described as an experiment that is a laboratory for
 exploring a potentially viable approach to an aesthetic existence that is not
 principally an effort at art as such as i explain in chapter 1 augusta app
 attempts to cast the question of technologies in terms that suggest their role
 in larger biopolitical techniques of governance that benefit from routine
 behaviors in the process it hopes to elicit awareness of our inclination to
 announce location and thereby render ourselves findable through such awareness

 what augusta means but also it might very well signal a shift in our manner of

 if in reaching a conclusion one imagines having arrived at an end augusta
 demonstrates otherwise in july 2012 the university of south carolina s moving

 keeping with the first this second reel is less finished most certainly a
 rough cut as with the first reel title cards name locations as augusta but in
 very few instances do images of the places so named appear in subsequent
 sequences there are five shots in which a typed nonadhesive paper label
 overlays and names a photographed place these include one that names a place
 other than augusta old homes in washington georgia in addition two augustas
 appear on-screen that do not figure in the first reel in this second reel we
 are presented with an augusta in wisconsin which features lake eau claire its
 fountain and its waterfowl we also see an aeronautical facility whose signage
 reads augusta aviation at which nixon presumably and his camera land

 mobilities at the same time both reels comment on our efforts to manage such
 mobilities labels photographs diagrams charts schedules maps ledgers and the
 like stabilize and distill into legible units our interactions with and
 understandings of the mobilities that constitute our world the two reels draw
 attention to various practices that accomplish this feat they make explicit
 our often unremarked and unnoticed habits of naming and subsequently finding
 we document we keep track we take account and we follow we record we list we
 enumerate we quantify and we calculate and we do all of these activities
 routinely because it makes sense for us whether or not we understand why we
 endeavor to establish nodes of connection and contexts for making meaning and
 count on this to become a habitual nonconscious activity this is what nixon s
 augustas and the sundry augustas that have been accruing since the launch of
 augusta app illustrate even as we may not fully grasp the underlying processes
 that make connection and meaning possible augusta points to the fact that some
 logic be

 makes accessible and renders legible things of all sorts from augusta to
 augusta that is from the augustas to nixon s second reel of augustas to
 augusta app we find that where-ness while trackable is also a state of mind
 that while a name or label may refer to a place it does not ensure
 locatability and that our investments in technologies of mapping and
 navigation underscore the fact of our being always on the move moreover we
 come to realize the possibility for new habits new routes new combinations and
 new ways to be in relation that said in the spirit of traveling salesman scott

 fundamental to augusta app as a theoretical experiment is the fact that

 both
 lsi and svd can be modeled according to the heuristic of the traveling
 salesman problem tsp this association will become clearer in subsequent
 sections of this chapter 3 a 1 0 version of augusta app was available for
 download from the app store prior to the book s release in print the 1 0
 version of the application featured the augusta map functionality only which
 tracks participants in relation to computationally determined tsp tours of
 scott nixon s the augustas the description that follows in the body of the
 text details the 2 0 version of the app which is activated once a reader has
 scanned the qr code at the head of this chapter and subsequently registered
 and signed on to be locatable 4 registering involves providing a username
 inputting a password and confirming it supplying a zip code and indicating one
 s preferred mode of transportation and favorite mapping technology or platform
 the latter three prompts point to nixon s penchant for documenting places
 bearing the name of his hometown or place of origin transportation networks
 and maps 5 turning the device s tracking function off limits that participant
 s access to ever-accruing augusta-related data 6 of course in the case of
 augusta app the population is a select population a self-selected population
 and participants may or may not opt in 7 the design choice for this interface
 is informed by my first encounter with independent insurance agent scott nixon
 s compilation film the augustas which i experienced frame by frame using a
 magnifying loupe on a light table at what is now called the moving image
 research collections mirc at the university of south carolina usc east the
 newsfilm library became the moving image research collections in 2009 8
 augusta feed allows participants to contribute assets one can upload images
 tag objects with labels and descriptors and add links to augusta-related news
 as well as establish augusta-oriented feeds and so forth 9 augusta app 1 0
 allows participants to click on augustas and access one or more image related
 to that augusta it does not push these images to their devices also the images
 that populate this version are images taken through a magnifying loupe as i
 first encountered nixon s film as such not all of nixon s augustas are
 represented attribution for the images belongs to greg wilsbacher curator of
 the fox movietone news collection at usc s moving image research collections
 10 the cache of keywords that classifies augusta is dynamically shifting while
 it initially processes the text of the book proper active participants
<< page >>
 who
 contribute to the augusta feed will provide additional content that will be
 used by the classification algorithms to describe augusta the classification
 process is one of collocation whereby like and seemingly unlike words are
 deemed proximate or close enough
<< dcq >>
 to be ranked similarly in this particular instance participants interaction
 with any or several keywords computationally reconfigures how these words are
 statistically associated to that is similar or proximate to each other at this
 level of interactivity data intentionally contributed by individual
 participants as well as gps coordinates automatically harvested from their
 devices will have become increasingly integral to the computational processes
 that constitute the application as such their engagement with augusta s
 different features implicates them in a larger and more global network of data
 regarding variously identified and proliferating instances of augusta 11 those
 who download version 1 0 will have already had an effect on the application s
 database of content their various movements from place to place will register
 even if only slightly a change in how augusta is interpreted by the algorithm
 12 here i am careful not to assume that any person who has this book in hand
 has opted to join the augusta community and is participating in the experiment
 13 digital supplement is a generic term for what might be called an evocative
 knowledge object balsamo as anne balsamo describes such objects are objects to
 think with 197 they are speculative probes 19 they intend to evoke knowledge
 by means of physical interaction in the process they interrogate conventional
 thinking and invite more nuanced and critical understanding of sociocultural
 practices more recently my colleague and collaborator duncan buell and i have
 begun to refer to such objects as critical interactives informed by mary
 flanagan s scholarship on critical play and ian bogost s work on procedural

 angular measures of distance are distinct from euclidean measures any
 euclidean measure of distance will represent proximity between two points e g
 cities as a matter of the line length adjoining the two points as drawn on a
 two-dimensional map here we might invoke the idiom as the crow flies a

 individual vectors depart from xi yl see cook in pursuit of the traveling

 returns for a query involves an intricate ranking process as amy n langville
 and c d meyer explain in google s pagerank and beyond the science of search
 engine rankings any one web page s relevance is determined by combining two
 scores a content score which matches data to a template of what ought to be
 important and a popularity score which depends on the data itself content
 scores are derived from the content index which houses textual information e g
 keywords title and anchor text for each web page this information is stored in
 a compressed form using an inverted file structure a kind of quick lookup
 table the inverted file structure registers each term along with a list of
 numbers an initial number refers to that particular term s document
 identifiers web page locations while a series of additional numbers represent
 an n-dimensional vector that indicates for example whether or not the term
 appears in the title whether or not it is included in the description metatag
 and the number of times it appears in a page see locations 36 628 645 and 717
 these numbers are computed to determine a page s content score amy n langville

 rankings princeton nj princeton university press 2006 kindle edition 30 here
 google is metonymic for a kind of process attributable to search engine
 culture or search engine society what i want to underscore is that user habits
 change according to the user s understanding of what google is actually doing

 unlike the content score whose point of departure at the time of query is the
 user s search terms the popularity score is query independent it provides a

 analysis
<< page >>
 model developed in 1998 by sergey brin and larry page the popularity
 score harnesses the information in the immense graph created by the web s
 hyperlink structure location 766 it delivers a ranking for each page based on
 the number of pages linked to it as langville and meyer explain these links
 are analogous to recommendations or endorsements each link pointing to a page
 is weighted according to the status of the linking page status is determined
 by considering the link against the total number of other links made by that
 page thus a page that links indiscriminately to a variety of other pages earns
 a lesser status than a page that links to pages in a more selective fashion as
 users surf from page to page by means of outlinks the google code tracking
 their searches computes the duration of their stay and tracks the number of
 their returns likewise it tracks when users opt to input a url and teleport
 locations 1064 and 1048 respectively directly to a new page and it registers
 when a user enters a dangling node that is nodes without links such as pdfs
 image files data tables and so forth location 1053 google s pagerank vector
 assesses in combination hyperlinking by means of outlinks teleportation and
 the inconveniences of dangling nodes according to langville and meyer the
 pagerank vector delivers consistently reliable measures of web page status
 across the google search engine index note google updates its pagerank vector
 approximately once a month whereas content scores are updated more frequently
 33 to identify keywords in the first place augusta ledger employs an lsi
 technique singular value decomposition svd that defines and enables finding in
 our present it identifies the quantitatively most significant words in the
 text by first eliminating those words the algorithm is programmed to deem
 irrelevant words that might fall into this category would likely include
 articles and pronouns as well as words that make very few appearances in the
 text additionally as langville and meyer explain lsi can access the hidden
 semantic structure in a document collection because lsi-based algorithms such
 as svd parse a text for synonymity i e similarity of words and proximity i e
 number of pages separating instances of keywords for example whereas a query
 for car might return automobile langville and meyer s example one searching

 been situated in space because the governed have been situated in space what
 is new and what governments are struggling with is trying to govern things in
 the virtual domain of cyberspace a site that doesn t match up to physical
 space here we might recall wikileaks or we might think of the policy changes
 going on with respect to cyberwar and cyberterrorism we know for example that
 if we target the iranian nuclear program we are in fact targeting iran but
 terrorist organizations conducting cyberattacks from multiple locations look
 more like wikileaks storing data at multiple locations with anonymizing
 protocols as a consequence it s more difficult to determine a strategy of
 response to a cyberattack that avoids collateral damage to noncombatants

 several commentators have mentioned bergson s consistent reference to the
 clinical studies of charcot and freud among others an observation that places
 him uncannily in line with current neurophysiological accounts of perception
 and consciousness see for example marie cariou bergson keyboards of forgetting

 39 henri bergson creative evolution mineola ny dover 1998 306 40 for bergson
 philosophy has the capacity to account for the relation between mind and
 matter as well as the ways by which we our intellect have evolved distinctly
 from other species and philosophy provides an opportunity for inhabiting
 indeed mobilizing this creative potential 41 henri bergson matter and memory
 new york zone books 1988 22 42 ibid 9
<< page >>
 43 it is important to recall here that
 bergson is writing in the wake of persuasive critiques of both idealist and
 realist positions he explains that idealism for which an image is
 representation and realism for which an image is a thing both assume that to
 perceive means above all to know for him an incorrect assumption ibid 29 but
 in endeavoring to chart a different path he necessarily resorts to an
 ambiguous definition of image one that attempts to dislodge the assumed a
 priori separation between matter s existence and its appearance that underpins
 western thought in arguing that interiority and exteriority of thought with
 respect to the universe i e matter are only relations among images
<< dcq >>
 that is insofar as we can only grasp things in the form of images
<< dcq >>
 bergson thinks about the problem or question of being universe i e matter
 including our sundry technologies and thought in terms that assert the
 coexistence of two systems of thought science and metaphysics ibid 25 26 44
 ibid 25 emphasis in original 45 ibid 38 46 david norman rodowick gilles
 deleuze s time machine post-contemporary interventions durham nc duke
 university press 1997 35 my emphasis 47 of course readers may recall bergson s
 turn to the cinematograph in creative evolution wherein he alludes to the
 string of discrete photographic images that acquires movement at the level of
 the apparatus he does so in order to exemplify not perception i e cognition
 that takes place at the level of the organism but ratio-scientific thought
 even as he explicitly includes perception in his short list of processes
 attributable to the apparatus of knowledge effectively collapsing the
 distinction between knowledge and perception we would be wise to return to his
 assertions about perception that appear in matter and memory published eleven
 years earlier perception intellection language so proceed cinematographically
 in general 306 likewise it seems appropriate to consider a related assertion
 he makes years later in the creative mind 1934 that thought even that of his
 intuitive method of philosophy
<< doq >>
 finally becomes lodged in concepts i e abstractions such as duration
 qualitative or heterogeneous multiplicity unconsciousness henri bergson the
 creative mind new york citadel press 2002 35 my emphasis in that same book
 bergson returns to the metaphor of the cinematograph to describe again the
 deficit that inheres in our everyday manner of thinking that is our habits of
 language common sense and understanding 23 so while we might allow that
 physiologically perception functions as a process of distillation which we

<< page >>
 might experience as if there were running inside us a cinematograph the fact
 is that bergson s cinematographic metaphor in creative evolution actually
 refers to ordinary knowledge and not the neurophysiological states of the
 proto- and core selves damasio that readily correspond to bergson s
 body-as-image of matter and memory 48 bergson matter and memory 38 49 ibid 50
 ibid 25 emphasis in original 51 bergson does wax more metaphorical at points
 describing the body as an advancing boundary between the past and the future
 within the flux of time the body is situated at the very point where the past
 which is triggered or called up by the circumstances of the moment expires in
 the unfolding of action in the present it is a kind of experience that brian
 massumi refers to as lived speculation massumi semblance and event 86 likewise
 bergson describes the body in its being a matrix of neural synapses and
 pathways as a conductor that transmits or inhibits movement bergson matter and
 memory 47 48 it is a place of passage of the movements received and thrown
 back a hyphen a connecting link between the things which act upon me and the
 things upon which i act ibid 151 52 emphasis in original what these metaphors
 have in common is their insistence that the body is never neatly delineated it
 is never its own discrete entity instead what is underscored is that the body
 is an ongoing process of being in relation informed by current
 neurophysiological research into brain plasticity catherine malabou has
 recently critiqued bergson s turn to the metaphors of telephone exchange and
 conductor she asserts that the brain is better understood in terms of networks
 at this point i am less concerned about whether or not his are suitable tropes
 than with how such tropes reveal bergson to have been invested in a
 neurophysiological theorization of perception catherine malabou what should we

<< page >>
 58 ibid 154 59 ibid 60 ibid 160 61 it is worth
 making a distinction between feeling and emotion as damasio explains in the
 feeling of what happens emotion is the emotive state of the biological
 organism it refers to complicated collections of chemical and neural responses
 forming a pattern 51 feeling on the other hand refers to the private mental
 experience of an emotion 42 any reaction felt or not understood or not is
 biologically that is emotively informed for example in response to some
 sensory stimulus e g a prick of a needle applied to a finger chemical
 molecules are sent to the bloodstream where they act on the receptors in the
 cells of tissues and electrochemical signals move along neuron pathways acting
 on other neurons and on muscular fibers or organs the result is a global
 change in the state of the organism 67 whereby organs and muscles respond and
 move accordingly e g sudden retraction of the finger consider the response
 elicited when a text or other message vibrates its arrival we reach for our
 device without concerted thought such changes to the overall state of the
 organism are not consciously felt rather they signal the body s integral
 connectedness with its surroundings in order for an emotion to be known
 changes activated by the emotion must be imaged and the core consciousness
 which produces the images that allow for a feeling of knowing must attend to
 the entire set of phenomena see 68 62 damasio feeling of what happens 43 63
 ibid 89 64 massumi semblance and event 44 emphasis in original 65 damasio self
 comes to mind 100 66 it is interesting to note here that damasio cites t s
 eliot who actually attended bergson s lectures at the college de france he
 finds that eliot aptly communicates the ephemeral materiality of the moment of
 core consciousness in the four quartets eliot writes you are the music while
 the music lasts quoted in damasio feeling of what happens 172 the point
 damasio wishes to emphasize is that this feeling essence of our sense of self
 171 is a knowing that is not yet known as such because we are not separated or
 abstracted from it because we are not yet autobiographical that is not yet
 rearticulated with the memory objects comprising our autobiographical record

 draw attention to the mechanisms of surveillance operating through
 computerized databases if the panopticon produced an interiorized subjectivity
 through a self-discipline and a self-scrutiny that enacted an always-present
 threat of being observed then the superpanopticon as poster describes it
 disperses subjectivity through the subject s willingness to make visible as
 public record her or his private transactions lovink and poster share an
 important insight in this regard people have grown accustomed to a type of
 visibility that entails less a self-disciplining fear of being seen than a
 habituation to sharing one s data traces see mark poster the second media age

 self-improvement this involves not abstraction but stabilization a subtle but
 distinct difference as rose explains persons are ephemeral shifting so the
 work of self-recording along with for example routine visits to doctor s
 appointments and compliance with other institutional protocols involving data
 accomplishes a way of rendering the mobile and confusing i e individual
 persons into a cognizable field i e a population 106 by committing to

 expressivity has to do with materialities of medium here celluloid frames and

 others do not consider precisely because they are attempting to explain a

 overlook that the medium too be it a page or doc file a photograph or jpg file

 sight and understands governance as principally concerned with the visual
 order of things even as he emphasizes the quantifying data-generating aspects
 of managing populations and ensuring circulations his reliance on the
 dispositif of the panopticon which never escapes its etymological roots all

 capacity for motion and commotion 211 those who constituted the mob in the
 colonies posed a destabilizing and therefore menacing force to capitalism and
 more generally empire nevertheless they were pivotal to imagining conditions
 of possibility for revolutionary movement in america by 1747 the diversity of
 the mob required a broader understanding of a lockeian humanism that
 underpinned notions of rights and liberty in response there came

 introduction princeton nj princeton university press 2000 64 he identifies
 this shift in governmental reason with the rise of the market as an agency of
 veridiction foucault birth of biopolitics 33 wherein prices constitute a
 standard of truth 32 the market as a set of rules establishes what can be
 described to be true or false 35 under these conditions government must adhere
 to the principle of political economy that foucault notes revealed the
 existence of phenomena processes and regularities that necessarily occur as a
 result of intelligible mechanisms 15 the question to ask is one not of natural
 rights but of the naturalness specific to the practice of government itself
 that government has a nature means that there is something that runs under
 through and in the exercise of governmentality 16 and effective or successful
 governance always respects this nature that is it governs just enough 17 in
 other words government must be responsive to the spontaneity of the market s
 natural mechanisms 31 and while there s also a naturalness accorded
 individuals it is so to the degree that their longevity health and ways of
 conducting themselves have complex and tangled relationships with these
 economic processes 22n 65 foucault birth of biopolitics 37 66 ibid 43 67 ibid

 interpret insect and animal metaphors such as swarms and packs as functioning
 to ensure biopolitical enterprise even as they are suggestive of the kind of
 radical i e headless politics that rheingold attributes to the mobile many 43
 in insect media an archaeology of animals and technology he describes how
 historically insects and animals have long provided a means to conceptualize
 social formations in western culture communicating both an image of neatly
 executed organization and threatening force but how these figures function as
 discursive formations shifts in the early twentieth century as the centrality
 of fordist principles underpinning industry gives way to new mathematical
 ideas 45 that deal with questions of emergence e g the traveling salesman
 problem references to social insects likewise change no longer simply an ideal
 model for conceptualizing social organization according to hierarchy and
 taxonomy e g of individual units such phenomena also offer an image of the
 social as an ongoing emergent process involving shifting variables e g age
 race gender medical history genetic predispositions education income location
 of residence and niche interests any of which might be tracked across a
 population we cannot think these interpretations of social insects apart we
 never have jussi parikka insect media an archaeology of animals and technology

 stanford ca stanford university press 2008 7 by 1980 foucault had turned his
 attention to the care of the self identifying it as the principle by which
 subjects might constitute or fashion themselves instead of deploying
 technologies of self that instantiate a subject beholden to practices of
 self-sacrifice and self-renunciation such as confession which seeks to unearth
 hidden truths this rapport a soi would take bios as the material for an
 aesthetic existence foucault contends that art should be a matter not simply
 of objects but of life itself living ethically means living artfully 8
